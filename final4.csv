Nately,1.0 ,"July 27, 2019",USA,RTQD4C2BKBICH/,B07JFB6PC7,AHJ6L37IWLAONTKM7EQOFC32EUPA,"very disappointed. we found stryve at the local walmart and liked it. we wanted a larger bag, so i ordered the original big bag on amazon.it arrived yesterday, we had some and liked it. then i checked the ingredients... brown sugar?! what the hell?by definition, biltong does not contain sugar or other sweetener for curing (i’ll turn a blind eye to raisin juice concentrate, even though that is also sugar, but not brown sugar).what makes this so frustrating for me is that the original stryve “biltong” from walmart does not contain any brown sugar (bought another bag today to confirm), so why the hell does the same item from the same company, albeit a larger bag, contain it?there is one reason manufacturers add sugar to meat products - sugar holds water increasing the total weight of the product, meaning they don’t have to use as much actual meat in the packaging. classic bait and switch.i love seeing biltong go mainstream, but only when it is actually biltong... and this isn’t it.",this is not biltong

NJD & DMD,4.0 ,"August 1, 2020",USA,R35A5MHXQPYSZ/,B07WTPGXMP,AFBCKRYTYGXVJLC2MAAGTVZD56NA,"biltong is a form of dried, cured meat that originated in southern african countries (south africa, zimbabwe, namibia, botswana and zambia). various types of meat are used to produce it, ranging from beef and game meats to fillets of meat cut into strips following the grain of the muscle, or flat pieces sliced across the grain. it is related to beef jerky in that they are both spiced, dried meats; however, the typical ingredients, taste and production processes may differ.i recently started a high protein low carb diet and needed something to snack on that's also healthy. i love beef jerky and was also curious to try biltong, so i ordered this. i love that this is a family founded/run company. as the product description explains, this company started with the owner's grandpa who was a south african butcher known for making incredible, delicious biltong. his grandson now, via brooklyn biltong is introducing this beefy, delicious treat to america, using the family recipe and methods. unlike most processed jerky, it's made with grass-fed beef, and it's always sugar free, nitrate free, and gluten free. it's really nutritious with 15g of protein per serving, 2g of fat, and 0g carbs (my favorite part). there's also no added sugar. the flavor is wonderful. i can't handle anything spicy and this has a tiny trace of spice to it but definitely tolerable. this biltong is marinated in vinegar and spices before being air dried, a process that gives it an incredible steaky flavor, and tender, chewy bite. i think the amount of chew in each piece is perfect. not too soft, and not like leather that makes your teeth hurt.like the description provides, it's a great idea to use this in other things too. you can top pizza or a salad with it. i took the suggestion to chop it up finely and include with my morning eggs. it was really good. the possibilities are endless really. but i honestly love this as a snack. i love that it's keto compliant!overall, i highly recommend this. it's a bit pricey but all jerky is and this is clearly better quality. i like this and will be ordering more. i think you'll like it, too. enjoy!",pricey but tastes good

Major Wager,1.0 ,"August 1, 2020",USA,R3INIL5ATMYCU7,B0176REM9E,AFDVXVVGGONZKOUQVYSIL35CUXLA,"this jerky is reminiscent of the sort i used to carry years ago on long hikes. i experienced no carb highs and crashes, just sustained energy accompanied by a longer period of feeling full. i've now removed all sugar and grain from my diet for required and personal reasons. that's been a good move for me, but it's not a lifestyle change that offers a breadth of relatively appealing snack options that don't require 45 minutes to prepare. this version of people's choice beef jerky i can snack on straight out of the bag. i think it's grand, and clearly many others who've written reviews here do, too. but there are also several categories of negatives i'd like to address, because some of the negatives are actually positives, some can be avoided by reading the product description, some can be explained through general knowledge of what ingredients are.* ""it's dry."" i've always thought beef jerky was supposed to be mostly dry, but not completely dry. it's nice to have just enough moisture to keep chewing on a piece (as you would gum) to reap the flavor rewards. that's one of jerky's neat benefits. but if you're upset it's ""dry,"" check out the product description. i see no misrepresentation of general moisture content there.* ""it's not tough enough"" or ""it pulls apart too easily."" the jerky in my bag wasn't easy to pull or even bend apart against the grain. with the grain, pulling was easier, but i'd expect that. my teeth played tug often enough, and i must have terribly weak hands, because i couldn't make one full strip of jerky rip with and against the grain into a stack of pieces. i could, however, cut it into a stack of pieces with a knife. if really, really tough, hard-to-separate jerky is what you're looking for, then this version might not be for you.* ""it's too greasy"" or ""it's fatty."" i wasn't constantly wiping my fingers on a towel to remove a greasy coating. in fact, i didn't have to do that once. i found it pretty difficult to visually distinguish much fat in the product. that said, fat is what helps impart flavor to meat, and all fats tend to feel greasy. nicely marbled beef is far preferable to cuts with little fat. you'd hope there was something of fat left in a dried meat product if you want some flavor. the product label pictured above says there are 2.5 grams total fat in each serving. a serving of classic lay's potato chips contains 10 grams total fat. ""greasy"" is a subjective sensation, but still, it's no trouble to check how much objective fat is in a product.* ""there's no pepper in this 'peppered' jerky."" well, there's no ground black peppercorn in this peppered version. however, there is paprika, and a nice dose of it. paprika is a fine powder made from plants in the pepper family. think bell pepper, red pepper. different paprikas produce different tastes. this jerky has a spicy quality. in the plant world, there are peppers, and there are peppers, and then there are more peppers. the ingredients list usually tells you which basic sort of pepper you'll find in the product.my personal ""complaints""? this product is worth all the pennies. my pocket book just wishes it cost fewer pennies, because i plan to keep ordering. oh, and there was some spice residue left on my plate after munching. why couldn't all that tastiness stay on the strip? ;)",worth all the pennies
