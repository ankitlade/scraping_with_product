      "  Very disappointed. We found Stryve at the local Walmart and liked it. We wanted a larger bag, so I ordered the Original big bag on Amazon.It arrived yesterday, we had some and liked it. Then I checked the ingredients... Brown Sugar?! What the hell?By definition, Biltong does not contain sugar or other sweetener for curing (I’ll turn a blind eye to raisin juice concentrate, even though that is also sugar, but not brown sugar).What makes this so frustrating for me is that the Original Stryve “Biltong” from Walmart does not contain any brown sugar (bought another bag today to confirm), so why the hell does the same item from the same company, albeit a larger bag, contain it?There is one reason manufacturers add sugar to meat products - sugar holds water increasing the total weight of the product, meaning they don’t have to use as much actual meat in the packaging. Classic bait and switch.I love seeing Biltong go mainstream, but only when it is actually Biltong... and this isn’t it.\n",

But wait! Here comes Stryve Biltong to save the day!Biltong and traditional beef jerky are more different than you may assume. Beef jerky is more tender due to the higher amount of fat (and in most commercial brands, carbs) with added flavorings and sodium. This biltong, however, has a much rougher texture that is quite chewy. The flavor is that of thick flank steak- flavorful, but not overly fatty or tender like a Ney-York strip.The biltong in my bag was fresh, not moldy, and the bag was completely sealed. I could not be happier with this purchase, and the only problem is I've eaten the bag too fast. I will have to portion out the ounces separately next time- it's just so good and such an easy hit of 16 grams of protein throughout the day!\n",

I was very excited when I came across Stryve because the pricing wasn't much more than I could make it for and it was so much easier to buy and consume on a daily basis. Initially they had some quality control issues but I have to say their overall product quality has improved tremendously... plus whenever I run into a bad batch (sliced too small, too dry, etc) I send them a photo of the product and they immediately respond and rectify the issue. Customer service is among the best I have ever dealt with. Everyone has a slightly different preference for Biltong. Some like it Dry. Some like it Wet. I am fairly ambivalent but fair warning this will generally be on the slightly dryer side... which I find understandable considering the bulk nature of the manufacturing and the fact that they have to ship it with desiccant for quality control purposes.\n",

It is definitely good tasting, a little different than jerky since its cured with vinegar, it almost has a bit of a corned beef flavor, due to the vinegar curing process.  Overall solid flavor, and the consistency is better than jerky- its more tender and easier to chew.  Reminds me of some of the high-end bison jerky that I tried before.  It is sliced in thin strips and good for snacking.  More protein, less fat, basically no sugar and solid flavor.  My only minor complaint is that its a bit more expensive, but the premium jerkys are also expensive so this is on par with those, and probably better in my opinion.  Try it out!\n",

I feel sorry for consumers who bought a bag of Zesty Garlic only to be shocked by significant amounts of spicy heat when the description on Amazon or the bag make no mention of spice. I imagine some consumers might not be able to handle the amount of heat.Unless I got a defective bag or something. Just saying, the flavor descriptions need more work, at least with regard to heat.Maybe a heat ranking system or something like that. Two peppers, three peppers, etc., to indicate relative heat levels.Also the Original has too much of a cinammon or Earl Grey type spice to it, that also is not indicated in the flavor description.The one good thing is that the beef is very soft though.\n",

To be sure, I'm coming at this as a long time jerky and dried sausage lover that doesn't know what biltong is \"supposed to be like.\" I also rather like the flavor of cloves, which don't dominate but come through strongly enough to be polarizing.What I don't like at all are the long term health risks of eating cured meats, and this seems like a great replacement. I picked up my first bag of this during a road trip because it was among the healthier options and split the better part of an entire bag with my driving companion over two days.No, they won't blow you away with how juicy they are relative to cured dry sausage. I'm sure there are traditional or locally made products that are better. The price is also a bit high relative to even healthier snacks like nuts and these bags might be too large if you're not sharing them among a couple people. They're calorie dense - that's the point - so you don't want to add these to an already complete diet if you're trying to lose or maintain weight.Nonetheless, these have become a great go-to snack food and easy addition to lunches for me. I've bought several bags of both the piri-piri and green chile and am quite pleased. In terms of price per weight/calorie, these large bags are quite competitive based on the other offerings I've seen on Amazon.It's a fair criticism to say that these don't quite match your taste or texture expectations - and I do look forward to tasting the competition - but I honestly find many of the aggressively critical reviews baffling.\n",

While the flavors are similar to jerky, biltong has a different texture.  Jerky is cut into rather large pieces and is often stringy, due to tendon and other connective tissue.  Biltong on the other hand is thinly sliced and, to me, easier and less work (therefore more enjoyable) to eat. I've only tried two brands of biltong, Stryve and Kalahari. Flavor is comparable. But Stryve is a bit thicker than Kalahari. And based on my initial comments comparing jerky, Kalahari is my preferred brand of biltong. Stryve is less expensive and is worth a try and still 100% recommended, I just prefer the other brand.\n",

The biltong is like a whole bag of those \"bits\" that i dont like in my jerky bag. i guess its personal preference . they did taste good. zesty garlic being the best. but i feel like i can make my own snack , by leaving the jerky bag open for a few days , drying it out more , and breaking them into small bits, or just grabbing from the bottom of the bag, for far less money. perhaps i got a bad batch, or they broke apart during shipping. but i cant see buying this over jerky in the future. taste 9/10, presentation 3/10, value 1/10\n",

      "  I was hoping for something...more. There was plenty of flavor, but it wasn't what I was expecting (or wanted). I got the variety pack, but all I could take in any of them was black pepper. The Zesty Garlic had some extra garlic flavor (all of them include garlic, this one just had more), the Teriyaki was barely present, the Smokey one had some odd 'tangy' flavor to it I couldn't identify (at least not when compared to the ingredients list), and the Spicy Peri Peri was a bit spicy but mostly just because of the black pepper. The texture was decent (it reminded me of pastrami or roast beef in jerky form). It wasn't a BAD product, but it certainly wasn't what I was hoping for, and left quite a bit to be desired.\n",

      "  Whatever I hoped these snacks to be is irrelevant because this product is inedible.Firstly, 0 carbs promised is not the 1 to 2 carbs these contain because of raisin juice and brown sugar.  Sugars are more than the granular white stuff used for baking and coffee with cream.  All sugars metabolize down to glucose which is the form in which they are used by our bodies.  Duh.Secondly, the taste of every flavor in the variety pack I received is, well, disgusting.  Even one of my friends who will eat nearly everything took a piece, chewed a couple of moments and spit that stuff right out of his mouth.  This process was repeated by a few more people.  We are a small galaxy of friends, but I can confidently say that the bite/chew/spew was pretty much our universal response.The biltongs look great, are in really nice thin pieces, smell great and are properly dried, but it is all a lie.  Ugh. I suppose if someone likes horrible tasting snacks, this might be perfect for them, but I doubt it.Plus, this deserves no stars or minus-stars, but you have to give at least one star in order to review.  This really deserves no stars.And, one more thing:  This seems to be a real and responsible company.  They have a nice web site and seem like real nice people.

Since I neither smoke nor drink alcohol, I find then over-flavored.The snack is thoughtful and probably a bit difficult to produce in the US, where beef is graded by the amount of fat marbled in, and priced by that very fat.  Ranchers and beef producers try to get the maximum amount of fat into their cattle to fetch the highest price per pound.  Stryve with a very low fat content is not easy to make, since producers want to make prime or choice beef for high price rather than goos, standard, or cutters& canners grades for low fat, and I appreciate their effort for good nutrition.Purely as a matter of taste, I won't be ordering it again, but It is a praiseworthy product, just not one I can tolerate for spiciness.\n",

The pieces are much smaller than most other brands of jerky I've tried, so I like to grab a handful of it and cram it in my mouth. As I mentioned before, my only issue is that it could have a little more flavor to it. It's not bad at all, don't get me wrong. I really do like this jerky, but I just feel like it's missing something, you know?I got the variety pack and I couldn't really tell the difference between \"Original\" and \"Hickory.\" Now, the spicy is definitely hot. I have pretty sensitive taste-buds, however, so YMMV. I probably enjoyed the spicy jerky the best because it actually seemed to have more flavor than the others, but that's probably just the spice.Overall, I'd recommend this jerky, especially if you're looking for something a little healthier than the normal line of jerky out there. With only 90 calories a bag and no added ingredients or sugars, it's a great healthy alternative to some of the other meat-based snacks on the market. Just be aware that it's not bursting with flavor. Still worthy of 4 stars IMO.\n",

      "  I've liked jerky my whole life, but only recently discovered biltong, which is somewhat less processed and typically doesn't have sugar added, which makes it better for keto, paleo, etc. The texture is drier and more crumbly.I'm not a convert from traditional jerky, which I still prefer because it's usually sweeter and chewier than biltong The flavor of biltong reminds me a little of prosciutto (but more sour and much drier).This Stryve variety pack has three different flavors:Original -- meaty and saltyHickory -- smokySpicy Peri Peri -- spicy! I'd say medium to high heat. Very noticeably hotter than the other two flavors, so watch out.I like that Stryve uses grass-fed beef and no nitrates.  And it's made in the USA. I would like more information about where they source their ingredients. Also, my nitpicks about the ingredients are that I wish they said what kind of vinegar is used, and I don't like there's \"natural smoke flavor\" in the Hickory variety.But overall, if you like biltong, this is a solid choice.\n",

Nice, smooth, flavor.  The subtle coriander flavor brings you back for more.  Ayoba-Yo was pretty good, but Braaitime was clearly better.  Then far below is Stryve biltong sticks.  They were noticeably spicy, even though they are labeled as original flavor.  Braaitime lists all their ingredients (beef, salt, vinegar, black pepper, coriander, nutmeg, clove, and lamb casing), but the package I receive from Stryve included an ingredient “spices” so I’m not sure what is hiding in there.

Lastly braiitime seems to think it’s ok to casually sweep large awkward biltong trimmings into the bags that are basically inedible.

Combined with the unique texture (biltong is new to me), it's hard not to eat this by the handful. Getting the right flavor completely changed my opinion. Try traditional first!Original Review: I appreciate the nutrition, great for snacking. The cut/texture is good - seems like thicker cuts of dried meat sliced wafer thin. I tried Spicy Biltong, which wasn't great. I normally share a little bit of jerky with my young son and even my wife has some occasionally. We all agreed that the flavor wasn't great.

I was hoping to relieve or even revive my first experience of true South African biltong, unfortunately this was not the experience I was hoping for. Biltong naturally is magical, it is not like traditional jerky. It is thick rare with fragrant spices that have a moist flavor texture. This version is nothing close to the real thing. Biltong vacuumed sealed and brought back from South Africa would score 20/10 over this sub par product. I will have to rely on my local Sud Afrikaans friends for a much more authentic taste and experience. Sadly disappointed.\n",

This results in much more consistent slices and a much more tender snack than beef jerky.I've ordered several packages of this now and they are mostly great. The first was just about perfect, only a handful of slices were much wider or narrower with very few fines. Other packages have had more inconsistencies including more fine bits and one package that was less lean and didn't seem dried quite as well. It was still perfectly edible but the texture was less pleasing. That's a relative comparison because it was still very good. That single package was a 3.5 star while others were 5.\n",

This Kalahari popped up on my search page and after reading reviews and info, decided to give it a try.  SO bummed.  This was the worst Biltong ever.  Hubby loves Garlic Biltong.  Thought I would surprise him, since he hasn’t had it in a few month and told him to close his eyes and open his mouth.  I put one piece of this in his mouth and he actually spit it out like a child.  He said, wtf is that, that is so disgusting.  I took a nibble.  Agree.  It was so vinegary and sour and vile.  Tried the original Biltong.  Outside of sour vinegar, no flavor.  Tried the spicy.  It was a powdery coating of nastiness, with no spice actually in the meat.  Can’t imagine we got a bad batch of 3 different flavors.  Must simply be this Biltong is just gross.  On top of that, a minor annoyance is the packaging.  It seems nice, but opening it is a pain.  The open notch is about an inch higher that the reseal zipper, so you end up ripping/tearing/chewing/cutting the bag to open it.  We threw away all of the Biltong, minus the 3 partial pieces we tasted (and spit out).  Luckily, I had also ordered several pounds of our favorite Biltong Superdtore/Biltong USA yummies, which arrived yesterday and brought us back to Biltong bliss.\n",

More salt and/or vinegar flavor would definitely improve the taste of this stuff a lot IMO. Don't get me wrong, this stuff isn't bad, it's chewy, and doesn't appear to have much if any fat or gristle, which is good, but there's just not enough flavor to set this apart from other Biltong products i've tried.

      "  As an ex South African who is very fond of biltong and droewoers, I was extremely excited to trying this particular brand. I thought the flavor / taste was pretty authentic but was extremely disappointed in the contents of the package. The product is expensive but this would have been justified if I actually received proper slices of biltong. The package contents were about 50% slices biltong and the other 50% consisted of “biltong dust”  Please slice your biltong manually versus using an electric biltong slicer - it’s not pleasant paying for biltong sawdust/ powder.Update: I came home today and was surprised to find a package from Ayoba-Yo containing a replacement package(s) of biltong and a note from Wian explaining possible causes for the biltong fluff. I am extremely impressed with this company and their customer service. Needless to say, the biltong tasted great and the contents were plentiful and fluff free. They have certainly won me over with their customer service and I will not hesitate to order from them again and I am changing my original rating to 5 star\n",

Biltong is a magical, sugar-free, barely processed jerky and once you try it, you will never want to eat American beef jerky again. Biltong made in South Africa cannot be imported to the States, which is probably the saddest thing ever. I have searched for the perfect recreation of what I have eaten while road tripping through the Karoo, and I haven't found anything that can match it. Until I got this Ayoba-Yo Biltong delivered to my door yesterday. My search is over. Ayoba-Yo is a match to the biltong in my memories. The meat is sliced thin and perfect for snacking. It is fresh, doesn't contain any gross preservatives, and the flavors are the perfect traditional blend. Try this biltong and make the switch, you won't be disappointed!\n",

      "  As someone who spent my childhood in Africa (1975-1987) I fondly remember the delicious food, especially biltong. I remember my brother and I trying to make some when I lived on a farm. We had friends who really knew how to make it and coriander was one of the main ingredients. This biltong has that flavor I loved.I also prefer this to jerky which is normally overly sweet. This has no sugar in it so may be different for most Americans. I don't think it is an acquired taste as much as it is a love of the spices used. What is different about this biltong is that it is sliced thin so it is easy to eat. When I was a child biltong was not sliced. But I think that is an improvement.I'm happy this is available at amazon so I can experience something from my childhood again. Sometimes you just want something savory, not sweet!~The Rebecca ReviewP.S. To compare this I ordered some other biltong that I used to order and I think this is better for me since it doesn't have the nitrites. Also has more spices. I love the coriander flavor of this biltong.\n",

      "  I have recently adopted a low carb, high protein diet combined with weight training, so I'm always looking for new sources of protein. I use protein powder as little as possible, and eat more from natural sources.I have a brand of beef jerky I really like, but traditional beef jerkies have a lot of sugar (10g protein to 6g of sugar). Biltong, however, has more protein per oz (16g) and 0g of carbs or sugar. Simple ingredients, and nothing funky. So a big win on the nutrition front.That is great, but what won me over was the flavor. It has a nice hearty flavor, and has a little wetness to it that makes the texture nice to chew. I have tried another brand of biltong, but I found it too dry for my taste (kinda of like chewing on plastic). So another win on flavor and texture.Pricing is okay. Good beef jerky is not cheap, so you get what you pay for. I would like to buy in bulk, so bigger packages with better discounts would be a good offer I would jump on immediately.\n",

If you want to check out biltong, THIS BRAND is a good place to start.Personally, I still prefer plain dried jerky from Robertson's in Oklahoma and Texas. Their jerky is more like the simple biltong that I ate in Africa, though the latter were very thick cuts of beef.

Maybe I'd buy more if the price wasn't so unsavory. I think them claiming these as some sort of 'keto' or 'paleo' thing is just 100% marketing, and used as a means to jack up the price further as if it's a special dietary supplement - and that's just unfortunate.

Tim is a natural storyteller and his interview goes down as one of the best ever on SC. Anyways, fast forward a few months, I get on YouTube, I see a Boikey's commercial featuring Paul Bissonnette, one of SC pod hosts. A few firsts came out of the commercial for me.  First time watching a YT commercial in full length, first time crying in laughter from watching a commercial, first time a commercial made me want to purchase the item, immediately....and I am a vegan!!! (just kidding). After collecting myself from watching the commercial, I login into my Amazon account and ordered a pack of Boikey's in traditional flavor. This stuff is great. No seriously, awesome. Take a look at the ingredients from some of the more well-known brands you see at the market. 90% of the ingredients sounds like they come from a bio-waste plant than a place were food is made. The ingredients contained within Boikey's stuff doesn't require a degree in Chemical Engineering or Latin to know what it is. It's all simple and natural ingredients, most 10-years will know what they ingredients are. So what does it translate into taste? Awesome and flavorful jerky....seriously. It's a little expensive for what it is, but like with most things in the world, you get what you pay for. This is no bargin-bin supermarket special. It's some quality jerky. I have no regrets and will continue to buy more. Tim....hope you continue to stop by the SC pod and I suggest your next venture is to bottle up Russian Gas and get it on Amazon.\n",

Thin-sliced, wonderfully tender, a perfect level of moisture and, best of all, an authentic blend of spices with subtlety and depth. Yes, it's slightly overpriced, though good biltong can't be cheap.

I get there are $40 12 ounce packages of designer jerky on the internet. Go for it, but if you're addicted to delicious and spicy beef jerky, this is that easy fix. Just enough heat that you can go through a bag in a couple hours, not so much that your stomach will churn in anguish. Also just enough spice to keep my girlfriend from eating any. Her stupid dog still wants some though. Anyway, great value $20 for 18 ounces and perfectly meets the spice I crave without giving me stomach ulcers, but potentially hypertension down the road.\n",

The consistency is much like real bacon bites like you put on a salad, just a little smaller. It also has a lot of fine powdery type jerky, but not so much as to put me off from using it. It works just fine, however it is a little messy when grabbing a 'pinch' to put in as it does not stick well together until it's in your lip.As far as effectiveness goes.

      "  I'm so glad I stumbled upon Braaitime while looking for a good deal on biltong. The free shipping hooked me, and the taste locked me in for life. Some may call biltong and droewors an acquired taste, in which case I recommend starting to acquire it pronto.  I grew up in South Africa, have tried several of the American biltong brands, and found Braaitime the best. I had never tried droewors (dry sausage) before, but seeing how good the biltong was I ordered a sample of the droewors. I didn't think anything could be as good as the biltong, but wow! it is not hard or greasy but is easy to bite into, and the traditional flavor has a delicate spicy taste. I promptly ordered a pound to go along with my pound of biltong. I switched to biltong for a healthy lean protein snack to avoid cookies and to get leaner myself, and it's working (but this is not a diet review). I think the end result is so good because they don't rush the preparation but let it develop the flavor and tenderness slowly to perfection, as well as starting with the best beef. Also they keep it simple, focusing on doing a few things right rather than having dozens of confusing choices. Moreover, the quality of the customer service matches that of the product. I always get mine in two days via USPS priority mail, but they do not ship when weekend or holiday delays would adversely affect the meat.Great taste, nice and moist, no fatty aftertaste!\n",

The spice mixture in this is a bit heavy handed with clove so if you like the taste of clove then you'll definitely love this. The lamb casing gives it an awesome \"snap\" when you bite into it. Here's a cost saving tip: if you go to the company's website, it's actually cheaper to order it directly from them (and they have free shipping) so if you're a fan of these like I am then it makes more sense. A 16 ounce bag (or 1 lb) costs $25 on the company's site with free shipping and it gives you the option of buying the regular ones or the spicer version (peri peri). And the peri peri ones aren't sold on Amazon (well, not from this company at least). So, if you try these out and find yourself addicted to them, then order directly from the company's site.\n",

      "  Biltong is a form of dried, cured meat that originated in Southern African countries (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana and Zambia). Various types of meat are used to produce it, ranging from beef and game meats to fillets of meat cut into strips following the grain of the muscle, or flat pieces sliced across the grain. It is related to beef jerky in that they are both spiced, dried meats; however, the typical ingredients, taste and production processes may differ.I recently started a high protein low carb diet and needed something to snack on that's also healthy.  I love beef jerky and was also curious to try biltong, so I ordered this.  I love that this is a family founded/run company.  As the product description explains, this company started with the owner's Grandpa who was a South African butcher known for making incredible, delicious biltong.  His grandson now, via Brooklyn Biltong is introducing this beefy, delicious treat to America, using the family recipe and methods.  Unlike most processed jerky, it's made with grass-fed beef, and it's always sugar free, nitrate free, and gluten free.  It's really nutritious with 15g of protein per serving, 2g of fat, and 0g carbs (my favorite part).  There's also no added sugar.  The flavor is wonderful.  I can't handle anything spicy and this has a tiny trace of spice to it but definitely tolerable.  This biltong is marinated in vinegar and spices before being air dried, a process that gives it an incredible steaky flavor, and tender, chewy bite.  I think the amount of chew in each piece is perfect.  Not too soft, and not like leather that makes your teeth hurt.Like the description provides, it's a great idea to use this in other things too.  You can top pizza or a salad with it.  I took the suggestion to chop it up finely and include with my morning eggs.  It was really good.  The possibilities are endless really.  But I honestly love this as a snack.  I love that it's keto compliant!Overall, I highly recommend this.  It's a bit pricey but all jerky is and this is clearly better quality.  I like this and will be ordering more.  I think you'll like it, too.  Enjoy!\n",

      "  I had never heard of air drying meat rather than low-temperature cooking, and I was a little surprised when I received it to find that it has a little bit more of a pinkish color rather than brown. However, upon tasting it, and experiencing the incredible tenderness and rich flavor, I was a new convert.This meat has the consistency of a delightful roast that has been cooked until it's falling apart just a little bit, but retains some of the fun chewy texture you get from beef jerky, while also being much more tender.I really love the lemon pepper seasoning on this, it is just flavored enough to be extra delicious, without overwhelming the natural flavor of the meat.I just started a ketogenic diet about a week ago, and this stuff has been a godsend for a quick, ketogenic snack that tastes delicious and makes me feel like I'm having a wonderful treat.\n",

The lemon pepper with a little onion is really delicious but I can't get over this texture. Most of the biltong that I've tried is like this. It's a sliced a little thinner but it's like it has a hard time staying together. My spouse loves this and the texture as well.

I'm someone who doesn't mind super spicy stuff (so it could contain more and not bother me), but I'd say that even people who DON'T like super spicy would still probably like the level of spice in this meat.The packages are pretty small, but since they're preservative-free, it makes sense to keep them in portions that can be eaten within a short amount of time.\n",

Everyone has differing tastes, so my review is partial to what I like, which is:1) dry, but not impossible to chew. The meat comes apart enough where a bit of saliva and chewing make it easy to eat. Some dry/dense jerky's require many minutes of hydration and chew to consume.2) does not seem to have any gristle/fat chunks that some other brands i've tried have.3) does not use soy sauce (therefore gluten free).4) minimal processing and not too many ingredients (KISS principle).5) No overpowering sauces/spices so the meat/smoke flavor actually comes forth well.6) not too smoky, nor sweet, not too spicy either.I bought 3 pounds for my employees and it was gone in almost a week. I like this one the best (flavorwise). I do wish it was a bit spicier, but I do like things pretty spicy (which could obscure/hide the meat flavor)\n",

I think it might be the cut of the meat that contains too much tendons, or whatever. So, it is hit and miss, one time it is excellent, the other time it is horrible.\n",

I would compare the taste to a can of hormel chili. Disappointed I spent $60 on gross jerky and embarrassed that I went on and on about how good this jerky was to the person I sent it to.I purchased the  Limón Con Chile jerky. It’s soooo good! I checked the ingredients of all jerkys in my grocery store and other retail stores and they all had sugar. Even my local butchers wouldn’t make jerky without sugar. After much research I found this company and I’m so happy I did!I know taste is very subjective but I think the  Limón Con Chile jerky has the perfect kick with still being able to taste the meat.I love thin jerkys with a dry texture and this fits my texture preference perfectly!The one pound bag comes with a lot of jerky.

I've had the spicy traditional (or old fashioned), and then teriyaki and spicy big slabs. Carne Seca is my favorite, but each type is so different that I'll probably get something else next time to continue exploring their line-up.My experiences:Traditional (old fashioned): this is old school, meat and salt baby. It's delicious, but tough and will give your mouth a work out. I loved it.Spicy big slab: Way too much red and black pepper, it's too much. But, If you scrape some of the pepper off it's delicious. I actually liked it because the spice limited how fast I ate the stuff. But People's Choice, if you're reading...please dial it back like 30%.Teriyaki Big slab: This was like candy. So sweet and yummy, its not the easiest stuff to chew but my wife still housed it. This is her favorite hands down.Carne Seca: The flavor is \"mexicany\", and it is very good. It almost reminds me of the old jerky that came in a snuff can. The texture is also completely different from any of the others that I've tried. Very easy to chew...My two year old can actually chomp on this.I have become a loyal customer and I highly recommend this jerky.\n",

The texture was perfect.  It was very dry, as jerky should be (I hate the moist stuff you find in t he stores) and it tears apart just like the stuff I make at home.  It did have some fat on it, but just the right amount to add more flavor.  There was a surprising amount in the bag, so paying so much for it was easier to swallow, but took longer to swallow than I had planned since there was so much of it!\n",

      "  I really enjoyed the People's Choice Big Slab/Whole muscle jerky, absolutely fantastic stuff, but this Carne Seca Limón Con Chile Jerky however, fell a little short of my expectations. The beef itself is decent, definitely softer, more moist and not nearly as tough and chewy as the whole muscle slab, but still a little tougher than the big time offerings from Jack Links and like. That is definitely a pro for some people and a con for others. The lack of sugar is noticeable, but as it is supposed to be Keto friendly, you should already be expecting that going in and I can't knock it for that. Having recently started Keto myself, it is nice to have a truly sugar-free jerky option available, there are few out there. Honestly, my only real complaint was with the chilies. I barely felt any heat at all while eating it but REALLY felt it on the back end of things (if you know what I mean!) as if I had eaten something 10X more spicy. Strange. I probably won't buy this one again and will explore their other flavors instead, but still recommend at least giving it a try.\n",

Then I met the Orange Honey Teriyaki which is a killer flavor!  But then my mind was blown when I tried Carne Seca - Limon con Chile.  Let me start by saying I absolutely hate the taste of lemon (except for lemonade).  So I was immediately turned off by the description but tried a piece from a friend's bag.  I don't taste the lemon which is good for me!  Then I read the ingredients and learned it had guajillo chiles, that's a new taste for me I was recently introduced to (thank you Subway for briefly having guajillo sauce).

      "  So, let me start by saying I'm a bit of jerky connoisseur. Maybe even a little bit of a jerky snob lol. As such, I don't care for things like Jack Links. Although they have awesome commercials, it is, in my opinion, not \"real\" beef jerky. Now, I don't know how the rest of the world defines \"real\" beef jerky, but this is the easiest way I differentiate the real from the not so real- if your jerky says \"refrigerate after opening\" or \"use within 7 days of opening,\" I'm sorry but that's not real jerky. The whole point of jerky, in my mind anyway, is that it takes a long time to go bad- it is real, dried, meat.Now that I have that out of the way, let me say that if you like \"real\" beef jerky, this stuff is awesome. If you prefer the more moist \"jerkies\" like Jack Links, Ball Park, etc., you will probably still like it. It is lean, so not real greasy, and the flavor is awesome. It is a little moist (not dry and super flat like Love's brand jerky- which is still one of my favorites), but not too moist. I've had most of their flavors, and though I don't care for the \"Original\", the \"Old Fashioned\" and \"Carne Seca\" lines are amazing. The \"Tasting Kitchen\" flavors, while not my favorite, are interesting as well.Now, to address the whole \"refrigerate after opening\" thing, People's Choice actually says on their website that they recommend against refrigerating their product, which is really refreshing. It does have an expiration date of one year after packaging, but I promise it won't last that long :).Also, if you are one of those people (like I once was) that believes that jerky should come from a beef state like Texas or Oklahoma, do not fear. This stuff comes from downtown Los Angeles, but it is freaking amazing.I will probably never be able to label a beef jerky my favorite, but this one is definitely in my current top three (Love's(Robertson's), Buc-ee's Peppered, & People's Choice).So, to sum all of my rambling up, you should try this jerky. If you're not sure, try a smaller bag- I promise that the next time you'll be buying more. And, I did not receive any sort of discount or freebee from People's Choice for this review. Although, People's Choice, if you're listening, I wouldn't turn down a discount! Lol\n",

      "  Wanting traditional Dry Jerky, not the wet type permeating every type nowadays. Had just tried Hard Times Beef Jerky which was what I was looking for. While waiting for a re-order of that brand decided to also get People's Choice Beef Jerky. Arrived today in a SEALED Ziplock 1lb bag. First slice looked dry and tasted almost like traditional Been Jerky. Was just a tad moist. The Kicker was when I went for my second strip. Surprise ! Refer to 1st image. It was white, round, fuzzy and the size of about a dime on the 2nd strip. As I then as I looked into the bag, noticed more strips with white & fuzzy discoloration. I poured the strips in the bag onto a clean tray. Found numerous strips that had white fuzz (mold/mildew) as small as a spot to strips that were almost covered in this \"extra ingredient\". Refer to other images. So, since the bag was sealed, either the dehydrating environment was not clean, and/or the meat was not dried/processed properly. 1st time trying People's Choice due to all the \"Rave\" reviews. Not sure if I may give it another chance. Contacted seller. Awaiting reply.\n",

Some may not like the occasional little bit of fat on the strips. I rather enjoy it, and consider it a part of well made natural strip jerk. Highly recommend.Original: I like to take jerky on road trips and camping, but have been really disappointed with what's available in stores. Almost all jerky these days is like Jack Link's and Krave; weird translucent gelatinous meat products. People's Choice beef jerky is exactly what I was looking for. Solid strips of dried, well-seasoned meat.  The kind you need to to use your teeth to rip a piece off, but is not too dry and brittle. I have a hard time not eating it all in the first couple of days.  Since the package isn't resealable, it's good to have on hand a gallon ziplock bag to throw them in once opened.\n",

      "  Best Beef Jerkey Ever.  It has been really hard to find a beef jerkey that has the old fashioned texture of Real Beef Jerkey along with a wonderful taste without all the sugar that Beef Jerkey's now have.  It crazy how companies put sugar into everything.  I have been around for almost 60 years, and I watched simple good tasting products like beef jerky and even Blue Cheese Dressing and Ranch Dressing, which never had any sugar in it before now in are age is just filled with Sugar, Brown Sugar, Corn Syrup, and even Honey.  Why!!!.  I think Sugar has become an addiction for most of us.  Anyway, I am really glad that People's Choice has kept the simple orginal recipe for Beef Jerky without Sugar and I just love this Beef Jerky and will continue to buy it for my husband.  Because of Autoimmune issues my Doctor has switched me over to just Grass-Fed Meats, because regular processed cows eat corn and soy that have a higher count of Lectins in the meat which cause inflammation.  So, I will no longer be able to eat this wonderful beef jerky because it is not Grass-fed.  It is normal feed corn and soy fed Cow meat, which has a higher count of Inflammatory Lectins.  For normal healthy people that's not a problem, Like my husband.  So, I will continue to buy for him this beef Jerky.  He loves it too.  But for myself, I need to look for something else.  So, that's why I have to give it only 4 Stars, only because it is not Grass-Fed Beef.  If you don't have to eat grass-fed meats than it's 5 star.  Anyway, Love this Beef Jerky, I hope soon that they will also have a grass-fed, Beef Jerky that is as good and simple in ingredients as this Original Old Fashioned  Beef Jerky.  Thank you that you left out the Sugar and Soy Sauce or Worcestershire Sauce that has Gluten in it .  It realy soo cool to have found a Sugar Free/Gluten Free Beef Jerky, now it just needs to be Grass-Fed.\n",

I  then bought it from their main site to see if there was any difference and it was good, but not as awesome as the first time on here. Then I purchased it through here again, and it was like a totally different jerky than the other times. Really thin and fatty/greasy/slimy pieces that still tasted hard and almost stale.

      "  This jerky is AMAZING.  Important note is that it's not the type of jerky you usually find in the grocery store these days (moist and full of artificial stuff).  It is truly the old-fashioned type of jerky I remember from my childhood, it's drier and chewier (so yummy!) and it's full of natural beef flavor.  The flavor is delicious, it's not covered up with a bunch complicated ingredients and processing - just very natural full-flavored beef.  I've tried a lot of jerky, and this one is just so good.  Don't buy it if you like the current style of ultra-moist \"flavor profiled\" type of jerky, but if you like all natural, NO preservatives, NO sugar, natural beefy flavor and old-fashioned drier style of jerky - it's just perfect.  I've already ordered more on a recurring subscription, it's that good.\n",

      "  This jerky is reminiscent of the sort I used to carry years ago on long hikes. I experienced no carb highs and crashes, just sustained energy accompanied by a longer period of feeling full. I've now removed all sugar and grain from my diet for required and personal reasons. That's been a good move for me, but it's not a lifestyle change that offers a breadth of relatively appealing snack options that don't require 45 minutes to prepare. This version of People's Choice Beef Jerky I can snack on straight out of the bag. I think it's grand, and clearly many others who've written reviews here do, too. But there are also several categories of negatives I'd like to address, because some of the negatives are actually positives, some can be avoided by reading the product description, some can be explained through general knowledge of what ingredients are.* \"It's dry.\" I've always thought beef jerky was supposed to be mostly dry, but not completely dry. It's nice to have just enough moisture to keep chewing on a piece (as you would gum) to reap the flavor rewards. That's one of jerky's neat benefits. But if you're upset it's \"dry,\" check out the product description. I see no misrepresentation of general moisture content there.* \"It's not tough enough\" or \"It pulls apart too easily.\" The jerky in my bag wasn't easy to pull or even bend apart against the grain. With the grain, pulling was easier, but I'd expect that. My teeth played tug often enough, and I must have terribly weak hands, because I couldn't make one full strip of jerky rip with and against the grain into a stack of pieces. I could, however, cut it into a stack of pieces with a knife. If really, really tough, hard-to-separate jerky is what you're looking for, then this version might not be for you.* \"It's too greasy\" or \"It's fatty.\" I wasn't constantly wiping my fingers on a towel to remove a greasy coating. In fact, I didn't have to do that once. I found it pretty difficult to visually distinguish much fat in the product. That said, fat is what helps impart flavor to meat, and all fats tend to feel greasy. Nicely marbled beef is far preferable to cuts with little fat. You'd hope there was something of fat left in a dried meat product if you want some flavor. The product label pictured above says there are 2.5 grams total fat in each serving. A serving of classic Lay's Potato Chips contains 10 grams total fat.  \"Greasy\" is a subjective sensation, but still, it's no trouble to check how much objective fat is in a product.* \"There's no pepper in this 'peppered' jerky.\" Well, there's no ground black peppercorn in this peppered version. However, there is paprika, and a nice dose of it. Paprika is a fine powder made from plants in the pepper family. Think bell pepper, red pepper. Different paprikas produce different tastes. This jerky has a spicy quality. In the plant world, there are peppers, and there are peppers, and then there are more peppers. The ingredients list usually tells you which basic sort of pepper you'll find in the product.My personal \"complaints\"? This product is worth all the pennies. My pocket book just wishes it cost fewer pennies, because I plan to keep ordering. Oh, and there was some spice residue left on my plate after munching. Why couldn't all that tastiness stay on the strip?  ;)\n",

      "  First I want to start off by saying I never ever review products on Amazon. The quality of this jerky and the fact that it comes from a family owned business is why I am taking the time for this review. I'm going on a road trip soon and was looking for the perfect jerky to take along. I have never been a fan of \"gas station jerky\" the name brands that you can find anywhere that have an odd chewy wet texture and taste like anything under the sun besides beef. If \"gas station jerky\" is the only kind you have ever had then please... for your sake try THIS (people's choice beef jerky) jerky! Other reviews comment on the dryness of this jerky and I just want to add that is just in comparison to what you would find at the store. I was concerned it was going to be too dry, be very tough, and get stuck in my teeth. Because of the ingredients and all of the amazing reviews I decided to give it a shot. Obviously I was pleasantly surprised. It arrived 20 minutes ago and I've already had three pieces 😅 (might need to order another bag for my trip) and I'm not searching for a toothpick or desperate for a glass of water! And the taste 😱 simplicity is perfection in this case! It taste like BEEF jerky lol sounds silly to write but once you try it you'll understand. Well worth the money. Well worth my time to write this. I will be purchasing more in the future!\n",

All the branded \"legal\" jerky was at best, just ok.  This is different.

Probably a perfect amount. Possibly too much for a child but a good amount for an adult who likes a bit of heat. The actual beefstick is not necessarily tremendous but definitely better than a slim jim and probably made better as well. Overall, the taste was excellent...suited me just fine.PRICE: Here's where I basically had to take away a star because honestly when you are thinking about buying price is a factor. You are essentially paying $2 for a beefstick you will eat in almost 60 seconds, haha. Although very tasty and may be a bit healthy, the price stay is a bit too steep for my liking.BUY AGAIN: Sure, I would buy these again BUT only when I have a little extra money to spend on something tasty.  They are good and worth trying and if you have the money, they are definitely a nice spicy treat.\n",

I'm unable to replace the value of the flavor, texture, and price point with any other brand.Now, to Zero Sugar. For me, fails on all three counts.Flavor – seemingly way too salty to compensate for lack of sugar. Even if it doesn't have that much more salt, it tastes like it does. The peppery taste that others complain about – well, I like pepper. Jack Link's Peppered is one of my two must-haves (the other being Sweet n' Hot).  This, however, is a weird pepperiness that doesn't excite me. It's not so much a flavor you taste while actively first sinking your teeth into it, but rather a weird bite that comes out as you relentlessly try to gnaw it... Which leads me to...Texture – only flavor of this brand that is dry, stringy, and super-tough. Some pieces have been so tough, I had to throw them away. I literally couldn't even get the chewing started. Sugar must be a required ingredient to maintain chewability, tenderness, and anti-stringy texture.  Last point...Price – not only is the value not there for reasons mentioned above (inedibility, to sum up), but because it was more expensive per ounce, it's more loss than just, \"I don't care for this flavor\"... It's, \"I paid WHAT for THAT?\"Perhaps this has fans out there... Fans with VERY strong teeth who do not require the same level of moisture in foods as I do.... and like lots of salt and weird peppery zing (or are so dedicated to no sugar they are willing to tolerate it).I am not one of those people.Bring on the sugar...\n",

The jerky is /really/ dry, with a very different (kind of pasty) texture, and instead of a nice beefy flavor it is very heavily spiced -- not quite to the strength of the peppered, but also without being clearly a single note like the peppered.It's not *bad* or anything, and if you're diabetic or serious about keto, this would probably be worth.

I wanted to like it because it was inexpensive.  It is just too sweet. It was sticky and I thought I had made a mistake and ordered a candied jerkey or something. The texture of the beef was good and it was tender and easy for the most part to chew. If it were a little more on the savory side I think it would have given Jack Links a run for it money. Jack Links is on the bottom of my list of jerky I'll eat. The best jerky in my opinion is still World Kitchens. Old Trapper is my 2nd favorite. Next time I'll pay extra for a higher quality brand.\n",

I thought it was natural fat/grease that warmed up during shipping so I put it in the fridge for a few hours but the gooey factor remained. On a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being ridiculously salty, this earned a 4.5If that score was more of a 2 or 3 I may have ordered again. After 1 piece you can practically see your body retaining water and swelling. Don't take this on a camping or hiking trip, you'll dehydrate fast. Will probably cause shoes and rings to become adhered to your body as well. Good luck with that.\n",

It took me forever to actually decide on these things, so I swore to myself that I would actually help you guys out once I got them.Overall, these snacks are alright, but probably not something I'll order again. They definitely have a pepperoni flavor, so if you're expecting something else then you might want to look elsewhere. They're slightly on the tender side, and a bit oily. Nothing too horrible, but you're probably going to need to wipe your fingers after handling them. The texture is similar to a Slim Jim, but the flavor is very different. It tastes like natural spices, not like pepperoni \"flavor\" or something. There is a bit of an aftertaste that I don't particularly care for, but it's not bad enough to make me hate them. The casing is natural, so there's a bit of snap when you bite into them.These are a bit spicy. They're not going to melt your face off, but they're slightly spicy. After chewing for a couple of seconds, there's a small bite to them on your tongue, and then it goes away. Kind of like mild red pepper you would put on your pizza, but not much. I like the spiciness. I'm amazed when people complain about spiciness when they bought a \"pepperoni\" product. These are fine unless you're one of those heathens that can barely handle black pepper on your food.Overall, these are decent. I've definitely had better pepperoni, and I've had better jerky. Costco has some jerky links that have better flavor, in my opinion. Still, if you're craving some pepperoni snacks, these really aren't a bad option. You can get better pepperoni out there, but at least these are convenient.\n",

      "  I ordered two 3-packs, expecting to receive the same quality as I would if I bought them at a local grocery store.  When I opened one of the 3-packs I purchased, two of the bags were in disappointing condition. One bag wasn’t vacuum sealed like the other two & the other obviously had some sort of manufacturing defect (see picture). It would have been obvious to the person packing this order because the package in the photo was the bag on top. There is a clearly visible diamond shaped cut in the meat before it was vacuum sealed. Multiple people had to see this and just disregard! This is unacceptable, especially considering how expensive jerky can be. I do not recommend purchasing these.

Occasionally I will buy one and every time I do, I totally regret it because they're old, dry and disgusting.I definitely do not regret buying a 3-pack of these though.  It's not as spicy as I would've preferred, but it's got a mild kick and plenty of that saltiness you'd expect from beef pepperoni sticks.In each bag is a single row of jerky sticks, 9 of them.  It seems to be sealed airtight, and there's a slight film of oil over the jerky (presumably to reduce contact with air).  Not nearly as greasy as a Slim Jim though.  Just wipe your fingers before typing on the keyboard again.Package says to consume within 3 days after opening or otherwise store the rest in the fridge.\n",

Those also had a more acrid flavor than the tub packed linked type. Obviously I prefer the tub of smokey link like beef sausages. But both were acceptable, kielbasa textured and flavoured sausages. The Jack Links were on par with the tub variety of the Wisconsin smoked beef sausages. but again, all three were very kielbasa like beef sticks, and all three very edible protein snacks.\n",

I’m going to eat them eventually, but compared to the general enjoyment I’ve got for other jack links or beef sticks, these are lacking.The cheese, though. I don’t know what this is. I realize the cheeses that come packaged with beef sticks aren’t exactly known for their succulence or deliciousness, but wow. The cheese tastes and feels like it was created from some kind of powder, with the wrong ratio of ingredients and moisture level.The packaging is good and the value (cost vs quantity only).Seriously, meat and cheese are damn near my two favorite kinds of food ever, but I’ll be giving these away at work.

I chose those 6 based on other customers' amazon reviews, i.e. I picked the ones who had the most positive reviews with at least 50 reviews each...I love turkey jerky because it tends to be much more tender than beef jerky.... to be fair in this review, I have to state that I currently have a pretty significant tooth loss, mainly due to my disability/osteoporosis thus i'm not able to take on the toughest jerky any longer like I could a couple of decades ago...the companies I ordered from were:- jack links [msg free turkey jerky, original flavor, 4-pack of 2.85oz bags],- oberto [all natural turkey jerky, teriyaki flavor, 4-pack of 3.25oz bags],- think jerky [free range turkey jerky, thanksgiving flavor, 8-pack of 1.5oz bags; gluten free],- country archer [turkey jerky, hickory smoke flavor, 8oz bag; antibiotic & gluten free],- field trip [all natural turkey jerky, cracked pepper flavor, 12oz bag; high protein, gluten free],- turkey perky jerky [sweet & snappy flavor, 14oz bag, tender, marinated, handcrafted seasoned jerky]…flavor is a highly subjective matter so i'll skip this subject for the most part... instead, here are my ratings of toughest to most tender jerky from the list above, listed in the same order but with additional comments:[reviewed product]jack links - the absolute worst imo with regards to ease of chewing... I couldn't chomp down even a single piece from the 2.85oz bag i opened, some pieces were pure gristle [yuck] and others could likely serve as tough thin soles for durable footwear... gave the remaining 3 baggies to my neighbor who has 3 sons in 20s/early 30s and whose teeth are evidently far more up to the challenge of taking on super tough meat because the were very appreciative of all the jerky I passed on to them...https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HPPPKRM/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&th=1oberto - different appearance from the above jerky... although almost as tough as jack links, I was able to actually chew a couple of pieces completely... overwhelming majority of the contents was unchewable for me however...gave the remaining 3 baggies to my neighbor and his sons...https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HPPPKRM/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&th=1think jerky - I loved the 'thanksgiving' flavor of this product, however, this was third in toughness rating... i really wanted to like this for the flavor alone so I tried 4 out of the 8 tiny bags i received but had to concede at last...i was able to chomp down about half of a couple of the baggies, the other 2 i could only chew successfully only about 1/3 of the contents... gave away the remaining 4 packets to my neighbor/his sons...https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0714KSKG9/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&th=1country archer - i kind of liked the flavor of this one as well although the appearance and texture were quite different from the 'thanksgiving' jerky above....to my recollection, i was able to chew down and consume about 3/4 of the 8oz bag's content...i threw away the rest....https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LYRFILD/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&th=1field trip - i was able to chomp down and consume most of the large 12oz bag, although majority of the pieces i couldn't, were pretty unappetizing - basically almost gag-inducing, soft but endlessly-chewy gristle with a couple of larger super tough, hard pieces...the unappetizing pieces kind of ruined the positive experience for me and the general memory/recollection of this product is overwhelmed by the negative aspect....quickly spat out the gristle containing pieces and discarded the bag with still quite a bit of unpalatable product by weight inside it....this one was most like the 'perky jerky' below regarding the taste/texture btw....i think both might be suffering a bit from being over marinated....https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V3M9HSU/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&th=1perky jerky - by far the most tender and i had no difficulty chowing down the entire huge 14oz bag... however, this jerky's taste, color/appearance and texture was the least appealing to me... it was way too sweet and had kind of molasses-like, malty flavor and texture for my preferences...i think it might have been due to being over marinated?....it's very dark and imo bit of 'un-turkey like' in appearance....based on this experience, a few days after i consumed the jerky above, i then ordered several full samplers from perky jerky directly via their websites; because most of their other product isn't currently available on amazon...i ordered a full sampler of their turkey jerky, along with full sampler packs of their beef jerky and wagyu beef jerky...to sum it up - until i'll purchase a couple of higher end dehydrators and plunge into the process of making my own beef/turkey jerky, i'll be ordering my jerky from 'perky jerky'... there were 2 turkey jerky variations from their sampler i liked very much and which were nearly as tender as their 'sweet & snappy' but more appealing taste-wise to me...surprisingly, there were also 2 or even 3 beef jerky samples which i found very tender and i'm keeping all those empty bags for now, along with some short, basic notes on my initial flavor/texture/toughness-tenderness experience for each, until i'll place my next order with them [blew my budget to hell so i'll have to wait a month or so before i can spend $100 or so to satiate my cravings hehe]…in my experience their wagyu beef - although supposedly a premium/higher end product - was generally tougher/containing more gristle than either of the other [turkey and 'regular' beef] products....i'll copy/paste this review without any changes for the most part, under each of the products above I've ordered via amazon...hope this will help some folks, particularly perhaps those who are dentally challenged like i am and who also still regularly love to chomp down on [tender] jerky nevertheless... cheers....\n",

      "  I was not sure I would like this, but I was looking for a  high protein snack.  I see these advertised every week when watching Major League Fishing, so I decided to try this brand.  I got turkey instead of beef because I thought it would be less heavy.  I worried it would be too salty, but it was very well seasoned.  I wish no seasoning was added, but it is not overwhelming.  I have been using this as a snack whenever I get hunger pangs outside of meal times.  I have managed to lose a few pounds just by eating this instead of reaching for a snack that would be less satisfying and contain empty calories. The protein keeps me going.\n",

They're are nothing like those.I won't be buying them again.\n",

      "['\\n\\n  Very disappointed. We found Stryve at the local Walmart and liked it. We wanted a larger bag, so I ordered the Original big bag on Amazon.It arrived yesterday, we had some and liked it. Then I checked the ingredients... Brown Sugar?! What the hell?By definition, Biltong does not contain sugar or other sweetener for curing (I’ll turn a blind eye to raisin juice concentrate, even though that is also sugar, but not brown sugar).What makes this so frustrating for me is that the Original Stryve “Biltong” from Walmart does not contain any brown sugar (bought another bag today to confirm), so why the hell does the same item from the same company, albeit a larger bag, contain it?There is one reason manufacturers add sugar to meat products - sugar holds water increasing the total weight of the product, meaning they don’t have to use as much actual meat in the packaging. Classic bait and switch.I love seeing Biltong go mainstream, but only when it is actually Biltong... and this isn’t it.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The listing for this product is wrong. It does have carbs and Brown Sugar is one of the ingredients. I bought this very specifically looking for a beef jerky (or beef jerky-like) option that had no sugar in it. This was advertised to be exactly that but it was not. I have no clue how the stuff tastes - I didn't even open it.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Finding clean, minimally processed protein snacks for a busy life is more challenging than I thought! Cheez-its and pretzels just don't satisfy my needs for an active, on the go lifestyle. But wait! Here comes Stryve Biltong to save the day!Biltong and traditional beef jerky are more different than you may assume. Beef jerky is more tender due to the higher amount of fat (and in most commercial brands, carbs) with added flavorings and sodium. This biltong, however, has a much rougher texture that is quite chewy. The flavor is that of thick flank steak- flavorful, but not overly fatty or tender like a Ney-York strip.The biltong in my bag was fresh, not moldy, and the bag was completely sealed. I could not be happier with this purchase, and the only problem is I've eaten the bag too fast. I will have to portion out the ounces separately next time- it's just so good and such an easy hit of 16 grams of protein throughout the day!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Brown sugar and raisin juice concentrate = SUGAR. That is not Keto friendly unless you\\'re super careful about the intake here. Doesn\\'t matter what the nutrition facts say it\\'s got sugar in it so anyone on strict Keto needs to be wary if they are doing it for medical reasons. The ONLY reason I\\'m docking to 3 stars is because the picture on the sales page says \"Keto Friendly\" which is simply incorrect and false advertising. I don\\'t really care about the bit of sugar but some people are on Keto for strict medical reasons such a epilepsy and making claims like \"keto friendly\" is not cool.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I learned to love biltong while living in England. The product I got there was imported from South Africa (of course). Now that I'm back home in the USA, I was so glad to find Stryve biltong! It's every bit as good as the South African original, and the price of the 'Big Bag' is exceptionally good, too. I'm a diabetic, and since biltong is almost pure protein, I can snack on it without having to worry about the carb content. Thanks for a great product!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I first tried biltongs when I visited Africa. They were juicy and had a very strong flavor that was unforgettable. I tried it another time at the local meat store and it was still juicy and full of flavor. These biltongs however are just beef jerky and not the good kind. They are thin, dry and pretty weak on flavor. If you like mediocre jerky then go ahead. However, if you are looking for real biltongs then these are not for you.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  As a South African I used to make my own Biltong as it was pretty tough to find here in the USA. I was very excited when I came across Stryve because the pricing wasn't much more than I could make it for and it was so much easier to buy and consume on a daily basis. Initially they had some quality control issues but I have to say their overall product quality has improved tremendously... plus whenever I run into a bad batch (sliced too small, too dry, etc) I send them a photo of the product and they immediately respond and rectify the issue. Customer service is among the best I have ever dealt with. Everyone has a slightly different preference for Biltong. Some like it Dry. Some like it Wet. I am fairly ambivalent but fair warning this will generally be on the slightly dryer side... which I find understandable considering the bulk nature of the manufacturing and the fact that they have to ship it with desiccant for quality control purposes.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I was born and raised in South Africa and Biltong is a very common item there. This is an excellent product and is made the same way that is is made in So. Africa. It sure brings back memories from my childhood. It is a little \"pricey\" but at my age I like to treat myself with something good. There are other companies out there that import Biltong but is even double the price. Glad I found this company. Will definitely order from them again.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I had been seeing a lot of ads for biltong on facebook, and it sounded like a tasty alternative to jerky so I figured I'd give it a shot.  It is definitely good tasting, a little different than jerky since its cured with vinegar, it almost has a bit of a corned beef flavor, due to the vinegar curing process.  Overall solid flavor, and the consistency is better than jerky- its more tender and easier to chew.  Reminds me of some of the high-end bison jerky that I tried before.  It is sliced in thin strips and good for snacking.  More protein, less fat, basically no sugar and solid flavor.  My only minor complaint is that its a bit more expensive, but the premium jerkys are also expensive so this is on par with those, and probably better in my opinion.  Try it out!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I was super excited for this jerky! I’ve had bolting style jerky from a friend who was stationed in Hawaii and I’m always looking for it! Sooo I saw this on amazon and was JUICED!! I ordered the big boy bag. Their original beef flavor.Got the package opened it up ready to chomp down on some awesome flavor!!Ummmmm. Yeah. They were super think which I didn’t mind. It had a plastic super smooth texture to them. Again didn’t really Ming. But when I bit into them right away it tasted like I bit into a peppercorn wrapped in a star anise. Very strong anise flavor for sure. But I figured I would try some more. Yeah, I couldn’t. The bag is sitting here barely touched. I shared it with my family and they thought the same thing. Man. And I was really looking forward to this too. Maybe the other flavors are different? But at 23 bucks a bag. I’ll wait lol.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Since discovering Stryve I’ve been hooked. I love the fact that Biltong has no added nitrates or sugars like conventional American jersey. The other Biltong snacks don’t have much flavour variety, and for those of us who like a bit of fire the peri peri cannot be missed. These snacks now have a Permian today place in the pantry!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I just left a bad review on something else so i decided to give some good reviews to the things i really liked. This was bomb, loved the flavor and was great for a snack.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  My husband loves these.  I think they are a little expensive but I guess I will spend it on him.  They are hard to get.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Good taste - not too salty or processed tasting\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Stick with the regular biltong. Stay away from the stick version. Slim Jim’s taste better if you need something in stick form.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I got this as a stocking stuff gift and tried one, they were tough and bland flavor. Wouldn’t recommend.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Best meat sticks for keto diet. My husband Has to have them on hand.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I sent these to my college Grandson.....He said they were the WORST Beef sticks EVER.  They were NOT EDIBLE.  Just ask a college student about food.  These were not cheap, so buyer BEWARE.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Delicious!!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Love the variety of flavors. Great little snack to between meals.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  The “Spicy Peri Peri” could be spicier compared to other beef products I’ve had. And then the “Zesty Garlic” is waaaay spicy for a product that makes no mention at all about spice in its flavor description. Almost as if the Peri Peri and Zesty Garlic are switched or something.Should at least indicate in the description of the Zesty Garlic that there is large amounts of heat involved. I feel sorry for consumers who bought a bag of Zesty Garlic only to be shocked by significant amounts of spicy heat when the description on Amazon or the bag make no mention of spice. I imagine some consumers might not be able to handle the amount of heat.Unless I got a defective bag or something. Just saying, the flavor descriptions need more work, at least with regard to heat.Maybe a heat ranking system or something like that. Two peppers, three peppers, etc., to indicate relative heat levels.Also the Original has too much of a cinammon or Earl Grey type spice to it, that also is not indicated in the flavor description.The one good thing is that the beef is very soft though.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The Peri Peri flavor is excellent.  It's not spicy to the point of being painful, but there is a slight burn that accompanies the dried beef flavor.Unfortunately, my package was probably half lean beef, half sinew, gristle, and unchewable fat.  Every piece I ate necessitated spitting out a blob of inedible fat almost the size of a marble.  I'm ordering some more authentic biltong and paying more, hoping that I can eat most of the bag.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  So delicious, tender and great addition to salads or other foods. I can’t believe it’s so low in fat and carbs, I was worried it would taste bad but it tasted amazing. I can’t go back to regular jerky again. Also it’s has twice the protein as regular jerky so when comparing prices for protein content this is a better deal then the cheapest jerky.  I’m on a lowCal diet that requires a lot of protein so this helps me meet my goals. I’ve tried spicy peri peri and smoked. These are both amazing.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Overall I like the 2 biltong Stryve flavors I purchased. I really like the zesty garlic the best. Good tasting and quality product. I just think it’s too expensive for the amount you get. I was thinking of this like a snack but for the price it’s not really a go to snack to me.  I heard good things about biltong though and wanted to try it.  I would buy again to have around as a treat though as I really did like the flavor and quality.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This jerky is spicy, which I like, but I could eat all of the small bag in one sitting.  If you want good jerky, try Buffalo Bills slabs.  You get 15 slabs per package and the most I can eat at one sitting is 2.  But more often I only eat one because they're huge.  It is low fat and hardly any sugar.  Good for Weight Watchers and Adkins.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I enjoyed the product texture and mouth feel. I could taste the quality of the beef. I didn’t enjoy the heat on this and I love hot peppers. Just not my  taste preference but good quality ingredients .\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I love Stryve biltong. I've bought both the sliced biltong and biltong sticks and they're both delicious. Not too dry, excellent spice level, great chew.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The taste is good but at the price they sell I have had other brands that I would say are better quality or provide more.  For that reason I took a star off\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Product was smaller in quantity and size than I expected.  Extremely dry and tough.  Not a fan, gave it two stars since it did have a spicy seasoning.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Very tasty.  Well balanced.  Not dry, moist, or sticky.  Not salty like some other brands I have tried.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I’m from South Africa and was so excited to see this products on Amazon. But this is NOT Droewors!!  The sticks are completely dried out, full of air and the texture of all the dried shoe leather. I can’t believe they are selling this product and I’m sad that people will think this is what Droewors is supposed to be.  The flavor is good but something clearly went wrong in execution or I got a bag of old dried out product. Try Ayoba-Yo brand.. it’s delicious and has the correct texture and weight.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Absolutely the worst biltong I have ever eaten. The flavor profile was developed by a brain dead box turtle. So confused and bad. I couldn't finish one piece. The dogs like it though. Well, one of them does. The other won't come near it. Lucky.It's so bad.So bad.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I\\'m surprised how low the reviews are for this product. I normally don\\'t review things like this, but I hope people coming from the same place I am aren\\'t too put off by them to give it a try. To be sure, I\\'m coming at this as a long time jerky and dried sausage lover that doesn\\'t know what biltong is \"supposed to be like.\" I also rather like the flavor of cloves, which don\\'t dominate but come through strongly enough to be polarizing.What I don\\'t like at all are the long term health risks of eating cured meats, and this seems like a great replacement. I picked up my first bag of this during a road trip because it was among the healthier options and split the better part of an entire bag with my driving companion over two days.No, they won\\'t blow you away with how juicy they are relative to cured dry sausage. I\\'m sure there are traditional or locally made products that are better. The price is also a bit high relative to even healthier snacks like nuts and these bags might be too large if you\\'re not sharing them among a couple people. They\\'re calorie dense - that\\'s the point - so you don\\'t want to add these to an already complete diet if you\\'re trying to lose or maintain weight.Nonetheless, these have become a great go-to snack food and easy addition to lunches for me. I\\'ve bought several bags of both the piri-piri and green chile and am quite pleased. In terms of price per weight/calorie, these large bags are quite competitive based on the other offerings I\\'ve seen on Amazon.It\\'s a fair criticism to say that these don\\'t quite match your taste or texture expectations - and I do look forward to tasting the competition - but I honestly find many of the aggressively critical reviews baffling.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This is a delicious low carb meat snack.  Unfortunately the food industry has ruined beef jerky.  It’s pretty much impossible to find jerky that is not loaded with sugar.  Not this stuff, it is low carb and tasty.  It is dry and somewhat hard but that is it’s appeal.  I take small bites and it fills my mouth with meat flavor.  No this is not your typical over processed sugary soft beef jerky.  It is a hearty meat snack that is a great addition to a carnivore or keto diet.  It’s a bit pricey so I took off one star.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I don\\'t have a lot of time to write a thorough review right now. I\\'ll come back and edit. I just want to note that I have been testing a lot of \"Keto\" style jerky over the last few weeks and this is my favorite. Most of the other options are very dry and salty in comparison.When I write a more thorough review I\\'ll include some of the other jerky\\'s I\\'ve tried. So far there are 2 that rise above the rest. These Stryve Keto Protein Snacks being one of them. People\\'s Choice Beef Jerky being the other one. And their 1 lb bag is a great value. (takes a long time to get through one of those bags. I took one on a camping/hiking trip.) Search: \"People\\'s Choice Beef Jerky - Old Fashioned - Original - Sugar-Free, Carb-Free, Keto-Friendly - Dry Texture - 1 Pound, 1 Bag\"I would say that this Stryve sample pack is the alternative to People\\'s Choice. People\\'s Choice is dry and salty, but very satisfying w/o the need for a lot of eating. The Stryve is tastier and not as dry, but also requires a bit more eating for hunger pangs to be satisfied.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I love biltong and droewors, bought this for the price.  Sticks are very dry, hard to chew, pockets of air and flavorless.  I can't recommend buying this particular brand.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  These things were surprisingly good. Not nearly as tough as beef jerky but sometimes requires some extra chewing because they are pretty dry. A word of advice, if you plan on being a few with you in a separate Plastic baggie, maybe bring proof of what they are. A security guard who checked my bag at an event thought they were some kind of smokable drugs. “I ain’t never seen no beef jerky that looked like this”. But they taste pretty good and are filling enough to have as a keto snack with something like a handful of almonds. Just have some water handy, too.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I’ve loved beef jerky since I was in the womb. I chewed beef sticks before I sucked a bottle. Ok, maybe not but I’ve loved jerky since I was a kid. All kinds. Slim Jim’s are gross (but I’ll eat ‘em) and that crap in bags from the grocery store is even grosser. It’s fake and processed. THIS STUFF. It’s so good! I love my jerky dry and chewy and this is addictive! Pretty good value, too. I got the original flavor and have already shoved about 10 sticks in my mouth. Love that it has good ingredients!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I am not familiar with biltong, except for the fact that I'm on a ketogenic diet and people have recommended this product. I am also not familiar with this flavor profile. Product arrived on time and in excellent condition. No mold, or other issues. I bought the one pound bag and there are a lot of sticks in there. They are moist and meaty. I'm keeping the bag in the fridge, as I think the bag actually states to do so. It's been open for a week and no molding issues. The flavor is also decently spicy. The one spice that sticks out are the cloves. Cloves are just a strong spice and that's what happens to stick out to me but these sticks are not overly spiced with clove. Spicy with a bit of heat. Good flavor, good texture, very satisfied with my purchase and would purchasing again. I feel it's a good value for my money.*****UPDATE***** I received these sticks on February 5, 2020. It is now March 8, 2020 and these sticks have no signs of mold, etc. They have been in my fridge the entire time in their original sealed bag. I check them everyday for issues because so many people seem to have issues. I think they must have a defective bag with a small hole somewhere.  No issues, still as delicious as on February 5, 2020! :)\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I thought it was a fluke, because I have ordered this product 3 times before. The first, was so good, I ordered again...but I noticed the second order started to mold after about a week. I just figured it was a one time situation, so I didn’t worry too much about it. However, when I (stupidly) ordered for the third time, the same thing happened....in about a week, my product was beginning to mold. Not sure if it is the packing or what (although I did notice the product that came the second and third time was significantly different texture wise compared to the first order). Since I have now wasted $40 on two bags, it would be great if either Amazon or the manufacturer reimbursed me. Would NOT recommend this product!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The pictures should speak for themselves. Intense mold everywhere. No idea if there are zero carbs in mold, but this doesn't look like Biltong. ALWAYS look through your jerky before you put in in your gob. Gross.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I was excited to find this product. A local jerkey place used to carry biltong, but stopped recently. I checked all ingredients (a current screen shot is included) and saw there was no wheat or sugar. I can't eat wheat due to an allergy and I've cut cane sugar and corn syrup out of my diet to try to be healthier. I was excited their teriyake showed on Amazon that the soy used was wheat free and there was no sugar. I opened my package and double checked the ingredients and what is included but both things that weren't on the products description. I still want to try the other flavors, but i can't make use of 1/4 of my purchase.The individual page for the teriyake lists the right ingredients, but the page I was on for the variety did not and showed a picture that was misleading.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The Zest Garlic package from the variety pack sits here unopened and sealed airtight, the way it delivered.  And you can see through the transparent window in the front of the package that the meat is covered in mold (check my pictures).  These arrived December 6th, though they don’t have sell by/use by dates on the packages.  Before writing this review, I reached out over a week ago to Stryve’s “contact us” section on their website and I never heard anything back.  I contacted Amazon, and this item is not eligible for refund or return, but they worked with me to make things right regardless…but the problem wasn’t Amazon’s to correct, it’s Stryve’s.  I shouldn’t have to say it, but a food product manufacturer should have a better quality control process in place to stop moldy meat from being delivered.  It makes me far too leery about the rest of these sample packs and the Biltong Sticks, so they’ve all been thrown away, too.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I'm always looking for ways to supplement my diet with more protein. I've been snacking on various kinds of jerky to curb hunger between meals. Recently I discovered biltong. While the flavors are similar to jerky, biltong has a different texture.  Jerky is cut into rather large pieces and is often stringy, due to tendon and other connective tissue.  Biltong on the other hand is thinly sliced and, to me, easier and less work (therefore more enjoyable) to eat. I've only tried two brands of biltong, Stryve and Kalahari. Flavor is comparable. But Stryve is a bit thicker than Kalahari. And based on my initial comments comparing jerky, Kalahari is my preferred brand of biltong. Stryve is less expensive and is worth a try and still 100% recommended, I just prefer the other brand.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  i read an article about a new kind of meat snack called biltong. It was originated in Africa. I was intrigued buy the article to try some, glad amazon had it , as id have no idea where to get it around my neighborhood. its closer to jerky than the article led me to believe , a little harder and tougher than the jerky my family currently eats, but ive had tougher and dryer jerky before and this snack rates towards the tougher end. i like it buy jaw gets tired after awhile . i like big pieces of jerky and don\\'t generally like the bottom of the bag, bc you get those small jerky bits at the bottom, that you have to combine a few small pieces s together to get a decent amount. The biltong is like a whole bag of those \"bits\" that i dont like in my jerky bag. i guess its personal preference . they did taste good. zesty garlic being the best. but i feel like i can make my own snack , by leaving the jerky bag open for a few days , drying it out more , and breaking them into small bits, or just grabbing from the bottom of the bag, for far less money. perhaps i got a bad batch, or they broke apart during shipping. but i cant see buying this over jerky in the future. taste 9/10, presentation 3/10, value 1/10\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I was hoping for something...more. There was plenty of flavor, but it wasn't what I was expecting (or wanted). I got the variety pack, but all I could take in any of them was black pepper. The Zesty Garlic had some extra garlic flavor (all of them include garlic, this one just had more), the Teriyaki was barely present, the Smokey one had some odd 'tangy' flavor to it I couldn't identify (at least not when compared to the ingredients list), and the Spicy Peri Peri was a bit spicy but mostly just because of the black pepper. The texture was decent (it reminded me of pastrami or roast beef in jerky form). It wasn't a BAD product, but it certainly wasn't what I was hoping for, and left quite a bit to be desired.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  After living in South Africa my husband gained a love for this jerky like snack. I bought these as a stocking stuffer for Christmas, and they did not disappoint! He recently went Keto and was struggling to put together snacks but I found these and they made his day.Biltong is similar to jerky but it is air dried not dehydrated. The flavors here were very tasty.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  1) All jerky is expensive2) Most jerky is loaded with carbs, this isn't3) this jerk is tender too (likely because it's sliced thinly)I'd prolly buy again, I just don't want to much protein in one day, trying to limit myself.  That good.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Whatever I hoped these snacks to be is irrelevant because this product is inedible.Firstly, 0 carbs promised is not the 1 to 2 carbs these contain because of raisin juice and brown sugar.  Sugars are more than the granular white stuff used for baking and coffee with cream.  All sugars metabolize down to glucose which is the form in which they are used by our bodies.  Duh.Secondly, the taste of every flavor in the variety pack I received is, well, disgusting.  Even one of my friends who will eat nearly everything took a piece, chewed a couple of moments and spit that stuff right out of his mouth.  This process was repeated by a few more people.  We are a small galaxy of friends, but I can confidently say that the bite/chew/spew was pretty much our universal response.The biltongs look great, are in really nice thin pieces, smell great and are properly dried, but it is all a lie.  Ugh. I suppose if someone likes horrible tasting snacks, this might be perfect for them, but I doubt it.Plus, this deserves no stars or minus-stars, but you have to give at least one star in order to review.  This really deserves no stars.And, one more thing:  This seems to be a real and responsible company.  They have a nice web site and seem like real nice people.  Maybe there is something amiss in the production of the meat.  Perhaps the spices got all wonkified.  Some kind of production misstep.  I wanted so much to love these.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Folk who drink heavily or who smoke will find these snacks flavorful.  Since I neither smoke nor drink alcohol, I find then over-flavored.The snack is thoughtful and probably a bit difficult to produce in the US, where beef is graded by the amount of fat marbled in, and priced by that very fat.  Ranchers and beef producers try to get the maximum amount of fat into their cattle to fetch the highest price per pound.  Stryve with a very low fat content is not easy to make, since producers want to make prime or choice beef for high price rather than goos, standard, or cutters& canners grades for low fat, and I appreciate their effort for good nutrition.Purely as a matter of taste, I won't be ordering it again, but It is a praiseworthy product, just not one I can tolerate for spiciness.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The casing is a bit tough and as others have mentioned these are a bit \"gamy\" - they do take getting used to but are not too bad for a quick protein hit during the day at work.  Not a traditional soft beef stick type of chew, they \"snap\" when you bite them and you need a lot of pressure to chew them.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Literally! We have to keep them in the house at all times. They’re the perfect snack (or meal if ya nasty), no sugar, low calorie, & a ton of protein. I love the flavor of the cloves with the spice. It’s just so addicting. The only issue I have is that there are hard pieces in some of them that make me squeamish while eating them. Other than that, they’re the best!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I am a repeat customer, have tried several others, and keep coming back to these. The taste is great, and the Peri-Peri spice is perfect for a spice lover like myself. Highly recommend!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I love these, great flavor and an awesome snack after working out.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I got this for my husband as his stocking stuffer. He said the flavor sucks and it is very dry. He equate it with eating cardboard. I will not purchase this product again.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Love Stryve Biltong, Beef Biltong Sticks!!!!  Great spicy flavor, fantastic 14 grams of protein, sugar free, 1 gram fat......great snack for Keto.  Will continue to stay stocked up in my pantry 24/7 of Stryve Bilitong Spicy Peri Peri Beef Biltong Sticks.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I ordered these as an alternative to Ostrim beef sticks. These have a very different texture; this stick is much harder. You can easily snap these into pieces. It can be a bit tough to chew through. These definitely have a kick but are not overly spicy; not uncomfortable at all. A good snack with a few crackers.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  These beef sticks definitely have a \"snap\" to em.  They\\'re a more dry beef product, but the flavor is decent.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Bilton is absolutely the way. Regular jerky is trash.My only complaint so far is a single stick which wasn't sealed properly & had molded. I'm assuming it's a fluke.Otherwise this is my absolute go-to.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Taste pretty good\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I've been a flat stick beef jerky fan for twenty plus years. I tried this and Bam, I've changed my preference all together. This is the best flavor beef jerky I've tasted in a long long time. Fresh,tender and bold flavor.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Really enjoyed the thin slices and the smoked hickory flavor. Helped me keep to my diet with a healthy flavorful snack and the saltiness and spiciness helped me meet my water goals.I have liked this snack so much I have order more for myself and for friends.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Never been a huge fan of beef jerky, but I love this stuff!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  The flavor and texture was great.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Great snack\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Since sliced but very flavorful very good meat\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This was not good. The flavor was really bad.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Delicious!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Really, it\\'s not bad for having no added sugar, MSG, gluten, etc., but my main issue with this is a lack of flavor.The jerky is a little thin and flaky. The pieces are much smaller than most other brands of jerky I\\'ve tried, so I like to grab a handful of it and cram it in my mouth. As I mentioned before, my only issue is that it could have a little more flavor to it. It\\'s not bad at all, don\\'t get me wrong. I really do like this jerky, but I just feel like it\\'s missing something, you know?I got the variety pack and I couldn\\'t really tell the difference between \"Original\" and \"Hickory.\" Now, the spicy is definitely hot. I have pretty sensitive taste-buds, however, so YMMV. I probably enjoyed the spicy jerky the best because it actually seemed to have more flavor than the others, but that\\'s probably just the spice.Overall, I\\'d recommend this jerky, especially if you\\'re looking for something a little healthier than the normal line of jerky out there. With only 90 calories a bag and no added ingredients or sugars, it\\'s a great healthy alternative to some of the other meat-based snacks on the market. Just be aware that it\\'s not bursting with flavor. Still worthy of 4 stars IMO.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I\\'ve liked jerky my whole life, but only recently discovered biltong, which is somewhat less processed and typically doesn\\'t have sugar added, which makes it better for keto, paleo, etc. The texture is drier and more crumbly.I\\'m not a convert from traditional jerky, which I still prefer because it\\'s usually sweeter and chewier than biltong The flavor of biltong reminds me a little of prosciutto (but more sour and much drier).This Stryve variety pack has three different flavors:Original -- meaty and saltyHickory -- smokySpicy Peri Peri -- spicy! I\\'d say medium to high heat. Very noticeably hotter than the other two flavors, so watch out.I like that Stryve uses grass-fed beef and no nitrates.  And it\\'s made in the USA. I would like more information about where they source their ingredients. Also, my nitpicks about the ingredients are that I wish they said what kind of vinegar is used, and I don\\'t like there\\'s \"natural smoke flavor\" in the Hickory variety.But overall, if you like biltong, this is a solid choice.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I have purchased this product many times over several years. I considered it the best South African style droewors available in the USA. But, something has changed. The texture is like Slim Jim now. It is like eating cardboard. I am left with a wad of grizzle in my mouth after every bite. I assume that they have sold out and are now using poor quality beef offcuts which has been pulverized to break up the grizzle. It is a great pity because the taste of their product is great. But the texture is awful. I will not buy this product again. Very disappointed!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I have no idea what changed but we have bought this product for years and suddenly it\\'s completely different.I don\\'t know if the recipe has changed or if a new person is making it but it\\'s not even close to traditional South African droewors anymore.It\\'s closer to an American-style \"Slim Jim\", which is not why people buy it.Until I see confirmation that the original recipe is back, I won\\'t be purchasing this again.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This stuff is definitely made from processed meat. The sticks are extremely regular and the inside looks like shiny packed processed meat. The taste is close but not really there. It's like a droewors-style slim jim, and if you don't know what that it: it's a low quality mass produced product. See my photoThe same company used to sell actual droewors but I can't believe the same people are making this. Something changed in the last few months. This is a premium price, but not a premium product.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  As someone who grew up in South Africa, I'm picky about my biltong and droëwors. Don't get me wrong, this is tasty, but disappointing if you've had better. I think the spice ratio is off with this one. From a flavor and texture standpoint, the Carnivore Natural droëwors definitely beats Braaitime by a long shot. From a thickness standpoint, Braaitime wins. That said, if Carnivore is out of stock again, I might buy this instead, but if Carnivore has stock, I'm definitely buying that instead, since the price difference is just not there to warrant the flavor difference.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This time our purchase of this product was very disappointing. There were hard chunks in the wors, and it tasted like it’d come off a factory assembly line. The texture was also not good. Not like South African droewors at all. We contacted the seller, and he asked us to send a picture of the packaging for the lot number. He later emailed us back and said he could only give us a 10% discount on our next purchase., since there’d been no other complaints! We said, no thanks, we wouldn’t be buying from them again. And it’s so expensive!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This has been the go-to brand for good droeworst. This last batch was not so good, and tasted less authentic while having noticeably lower quality meat.  To the maker: please don't downgrade quality. We will pay more, but at this quality your product is not worth buying.I have ordered one more 3lb batch, on faith. If it is not good, I'll stop buying. If it is I'll update here.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  After learning that real food is meat, and being disappointed in beef jerky makers pumping sugar into their products, I was glad to discover biltong and droewors.  They are delicious and most brands have no sugar.  To figure out which brand to get, I purchased several at once to compare.I’ve tried out 3 different brands of Droewors:(1) Braaitime(2) Ayoba-Yo(3) StryveBy far, Braaitime is the best of the bunch.  Nice, smooth, flavor.  The subtle coriander flavor brings you back for more.  Ayoba-Yo was pretty good, but Braaitime was clearly better.  Then far below is Stryve biltong sticks.  They were noticeably spicy, even though they are labeled as original flavor.  Braaitime lists all their ingredients (beef, salt, vinegar, black pepper, coriander, nutmeg, clove, and lamb casing), but the package I receive from Stryve included an ingredient “spices” so I’m not sure what is hiding in there.  I really hope Braaitime continues to sell their droewors product because it is far superior to the Stryve brand.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  We’ve ordered these through several retailers over the years and these were often our go to droerwors. The last bag we got was drier, had more grizzle, and was broken up into smaller pieces (which could account foe some of the dryness) than previous bags. I see other reviews mention this change in quality so I’m not sure we’ll order from here again since there are less expensive brands that have the same quality as this most recent batch.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Totally love this!! Grew up with droewors and recently we spoiled ourselves with a few bags of these. It hardly lasted a day! Needless to say, we have a problem! It came in timely fashion, well packaged and has a great flavor which brings back fond memories. Thank you very much!!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This is not traditional dried South Frican sausage. Horrible texture, with a kind of slim jim influence. Terribly disappointed. One bag was not sealed properly.Even compated to the picture, what is inside the bag is different. This is misrepresented.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I've bought Biltong from Braatime before and have always been fairly happy with the product.  The flavor is on point and the delivery is pretty quick.  The quality has been pretty good and fairly consistent.  Unfortunately, this order the quality seemed to have slipped a lot.  Looking at the package I saw that there was a lot of, for lack of a better term, shake (urban dictionary the term lol) in the package.  It appeared to be a mixture of seasonings, wood flakes, and meat crumbs.  After we picked out all of the biltong we weighed the remainder of what was in the bag and there was almost 7 ounces of shake out of a 16 ounce bag.  I would have sent the product back because it was really substandard but my son had already opened the package and started feasting on it before I could repackage it.  I'll try Braatime one more time but if I get a lot of shake in the bag again I'll be disavowing them and going with Bledie Lekker Biltong.  I've added pictures showing before picking out the Biltong and after.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I’ve been buying this jerky from braiitime for almost three years now and the quality keeps going down down down. It’s seems like every time I buy another bag of biltong it’s SALTIER and SALTIER. Almost to the point of being inedible. In addition to that biltong is supposed to be super thin slices from a large piece of dried beef. I’ve noticed the slices also keep getting slightly thicker causing them to be difficult to chew. Lastly braiitime seems to think it’s ok to casually sweep large awkward biltong trimmings into the bags that are basically inedible. They are Cube like pieces the machine didn’t process and they get thrown out each time I encounter them. Braiitimes jerky used to be more seasoned and less SALTED. It also used to be cut so nice and thin is was easy to eat it by the hand full. I find myself now carefully eating one piece at a time because it’s like chewing on pieces of a leather belt. Not sure what has changed with their process but I’m pretty sure this is the very last bag of biltong I’m ever buying from braiitime.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This product has been on our Subscribe and Save monthly list for quite some time because we love it so much. However, we received a bag in our most recent shipment that was old, stale, and not good. We tried to return it but then realized that this product was not eligible for return. So $30 down the drain for one whole bag we cannot eat. We're taking this off our Subscribe and Save list and searching for a similar product with a better return policy.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  If you found yourself surfing Amazon for some quality beef jerky and came across this product then the first thing you should know is that this is not your typical Americanized beef jerky. There's no artificial flavors, honey, pounds of salt or needless calories added to the mix here. This is simply dried beef with a light touch of salt, black pepper and coriander.It's not sweet, it's not spicy… it's beef. It tastes like dried beef because that's all it is! It's how true beef jerky was made and how it still is to this day in South Africa. If you're looking for a taste, low calorie and healthy snack then look no further. Easily the best 'beef jerky' (dried beef) on the market!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I’ve been subscribe and save for several years,  and love the jerky.  The problem is over the past year I’ve seen a big drop in their QC.  I started getting bags of mostly sawdust like shavings with very little actual slices of jerky.  The last two monthly shippings have been almost all shavings.  It is as if they put all of the byproduct into my bags.  I just canceled my subscription because this item is to expensive to just get bags of shavings. No QC obviously.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  The product had mostly powdered beef bits and not actual pieces.  The flavor is decent, but almost impossible to eat.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Pretty high quality Biltong. My favorite brand and my favorite style of jerky.For anyone who wants to know, it tastes a bit like parmesan cheese. Atleast to me, anyways.Don't put it in a warm, humid place. That goes without saying, but this stuff Is particularly sensitive since it is basically just really dry raw meat.Don't rehydrate this stuff unless it's in your stomach.It's really good with trail mix, or dried fruit. Great for a hike.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Good flavour with a light feel to it. It tastes like beef with a hint of vinegar, but it's not overpowering. It's not like the overly flavoured or strong beef jerky mostly found in the US. Make no  mistake, this is not slab jerky (well it's not JERKY per se...) But it has a very unique, light flavour that I really liked, perhaps because it tasted like beef and not an overwhelming attempt to be another flavour.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This is 100% bona fide south africa tasting biltong!  This is a really great product. I’ve had Genuine  South African biltong made out of or oryx and kudu which is excellent.  This one taste just like it same texture same smell same taste I highly recommend it for anybody that likes jerky.  The problem is most mass produce jerky in the United States was just A bunch of pressed meat the doesn’t taste very good. These are real pieces of meat easy to chew and life of her own I highly recommend it\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This is pretty pure.  Only like 4 ingredients.  Water, salt, vinegar and the dried beef.  I think that's all.  Delicious.  I LOVE it.Update: Sept 1, 2019.  I got some of this again today...maybe the 6th bag I've ordered.  However, it came in a clear plastic bag.  Some of the meat was much chunkier than in the past, and I'm no longer a 5 star believer.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  When I first opened the package the smell surprised me.  If you’re looking for typical, this isn’t for you.  This is not a standard bag of “jerky”.  This is biltong.  When I took the first bite I was put off by the blend of seasonings.  The meat was in small very thin strips or thin chunks.  The meat was easy to bite through.  The meat was clean and not greasy!  But the blend of spices?????  It didn’t seem right.  I closed the bag, put it in the cupboard and quickly realized I had a problem.Fifteen minutes later I was craving a piece.  Ok...ok...the rest of the bag over the next 1/2 hour.  Something about the spices, the texture and the smell!  I have already ordered another bag.So, the question everyone keeps asking.  IS IT BETTER THAN JERKY?  The answer is, “No, but it is different than jerky.”To steal from a famous fast food chain...”Ayobo-Yo Biltong is different, different is good.”\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Maybe I got a bad batch, but these were not spicy at all and the texture was strange for beef jerky. Almost squishy and slimy.1/26 Edit: Ayoba-yo sent me a replacement after seeing my original review. This new bag is leaps and bounds better than the one I originally got. Has a nice tender, but firm feel to it. The spice is much better, too. I must have gotten a bad batch the first time, because this one is great! And a big shout out to Wian and the team at Ayoba-yo. This is a company that cares about satisfying the customer and ensuring a quality product.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Update: Great customer service! They provided a pack of traditional flavor after seeing my review (originally 3 stars, now 5). The traditional flavor is MUCH better and passed the taste-test from everyone in my house. I imagined traditional flavor would be like spicy - just milder. I was wrong, it's a very different flavor, more familiar to American jerky, but still very unique and delicious. Combined with the unique texture (biltong is new to me), it's hard not to eat this by the handful. Getting the right flavor completely changed my opinion. Try traditional first!Original Review: I appreciate the nutrition, great for snacking. The cut/texture is good - seems like thicker cuts of dried meat sliced wafer thin. I tried Spicy Biltong, which wasn't great. I normally share a little bit of jerky with my young son and even my wife has some occasionally. We all agreed that the flavor wasn't great. Maybe other flavors are better. Better flavor would have made all the difference, but at this price, I probably won't risk it.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  First time I tried this. I got the spicy one and it was fabulous. Spiced just right and the larger pieces were tender enough for these old teeth.The only problem I had was one of the packages had a lot of meat sawdust which was drier and more like jerky, the other package had much less of the flakes.I only bought two packages so maybe it was the end of the run  for the flakey one. Don’t let that stop you though, I am reordering today.Man I would love to be the guy on the cutting table!This is a review of a review. I got two more packages and the sawdust was even worse. There were a few larger pieces but most of it was like the \"jerky snuff\" you get at the 7-11 Store.It still taste pretty good but I would liked to have had a few bigger pieces to put in my pocket while fishing.I do not mind paying a premium price, I just want a premium product, this is just mediocre.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I found this item to be very tasty.I would not describe it as spicy, at all, if you equate spicy with heavily spiced  heat. It is flavorful, however, and nicely so.  You can see my other reviews to gauge my interpretation of spicy. This is not it, but I enjoyed it, and I enjoyed my experience doing business with the seller.  I misread the expiration date on the bag, which was 100% my fault.The item was well in date and fresh and moist tasting. My one date-related question was politely answered in seconds. I would buy this again for a jerky lover. Jalapeño is about the spice level. It doesn't taste like jalapeños, but this would be my rating on the heat scale if I were equating out to peppers.  It was quite tasty really.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The product has a beefy afternoon, but by no means represents what true biltong should taste and feel like. The bag is mostly dust of super thin shavings. I was hoping to relieve or even revive my first experience of true South African biltong, unfortunately this was not the experience I was hoping for. Biltong naturally is magical, it is not like traditional jerky. It is thick rare with fragrant spices that have a moist flavor texture. This version is nothing close to the real thing. Biltong vacuumed sealed and brought back from South Africa would score 20/10 over this sub par product. I will have to rely on my local Sud Afrikaans friends for a much more authentic taste and experience. Sadly disappointed.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I really enjoy beef jerky but drying meat on a cross grain cut results in subpar product. Biltong is dried in larger pieces, then cut into thin strips against the grain. This results in much more consistent slices and a much more tender snack than beef jerky.I've ordered several packages of this now and they are mostly great. The first was just about perfect, only a handful of slices were much wider or narrower with very few fines. Other packages have had more inconsistencies including more fine bits and one package that was less lean and didn't seem dried quite as well. It was still perfectly edible but the texture was less pleasing. That's a relative comparison because it was still very good. That single package was a 3.5 star while others were 5.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  If you are like me searching for a clean spicy meat that has no any kind of disgusting sweetness that exist in each Jerky in the US, then this is your PERFECT jerky ! Has been living in the US for more than 7 years and tried 10s of jerkies kind with no success to what should be clean spicy Jerky. Always , suger, starch, honey, glaze . .This one not only suger free, but sweetness free ! It has that heat that creaps on your head nicely!Two things though:1- it is not cheap at all2- small cuts, like SUPER tiny slices and this results in some crumbs of meat that you won't enjoy like the ones you have at the end of a chips bag.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I was anticipating something amazing, but sadly this product doesn't deliver!!! I absolutely love spicy beef jerky and this is not it. The flavor is very bland and there is no spicy whatsoever. I plan to give these to someone at work and I'm annoyed that I bought 3 with no way to return the two that are unopened. I am very disappointed in this product.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Ayobo-Yo right / authentic left (pictured)I’d been wanting to try biltong for awhile and finally decided on this. I saw the reviews were bit all over the place but the majority were good, so went for it. I’d never had biltong, so didn’t really know what to expect. The flavor is great but each piece is incredibly small, thin and so chewy that it’s nearly impossible to chew completely. I chalked it up to just not being into biltong until my South Africa neighbor brought over some! Wow! What a difference!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  What I liked most about the brand is the similarity to real beef biltong being a (Zimbabwean by origin and birth) this was one of the most similar products ive tried!

I'm always looking for Biltong for my Keto diet and when I saw these guys made some I jumped on it!!! All their stuff is great, so I knew this would be. It's seasoned perfectly!

Good size cuts, perfect moisture, excellent price, great recipe...Don't change a thing.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  We had tried some biltong purchased locally at a dept. store.  It was worse than jerky. I then ordered 2 bags of the black garlic flavor of this righteous felon from amazon .It came today. It gained a super 5 stars from my husband and I and my son! Super flavorful! Not tough at all! Social media would be a way to  great way to advertise.  It is pricey so free shipping would be a must for me. Very worth a buy! Cant wait to try some other flavors! Thank you!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I liked the freshness and quality of the meat, but when I think of biltong, I think of  meatier, chewier beef cubes, not the thinner jerky that is typical here. While the flavor was quite good, it did not share the appearance or texture of other biltong I had. I think this was more like a biltong-flavored jerky than a true biltong. Good nonetheless, fresh and tasty, but not exactly what I was hoping for.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I have tried a few types of biltong but they all ended up being super dry and bland. When I came across these I was worried the garlic was going to be very overpowering but man it’s amazing! The flavor is perfectly balanced and the meat is extremely moist. Just found myself a new go to protein snack!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n\\n  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Throughly enjoyed Righteous Felon Biltong! I first had biltong in South Africa. Right away I fell in love with the texture right away. It’s different from regular beef jerky. The Righteous Felon biltong captures the tenderness and flavor of the black garlic. I posted in Instagram to spread the word about this awesome brand.Duane Sanchez\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I wanted to get my first experience with Biltong and tried Righteous Felon's pack. First opening the package, smell was great but the shredded thin sliced meat kinda set me off. Flavor wise... it was like eating dried lightly seasoned ham, was pretty average for my taste. I wasn't too excited when I got to my 2nd bag, just wanted to get done with it. For the price and my experience with this brand... wasn't worth buying next time. Great packaging though!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  compared to other biltong I have purchased the texture here was just off, i LOVE the flavor, but the meat was almost too wet and greasy, might have something to do with it coming in a very sharp and cool looking black envelope on a 100-degree day, but all the same, I look forward to trying other product by this company, as that black garlic flavor was really good\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I'm fairly new to this product, but will admit that is now my favorite biltong, at least flavor-wise. I look forward to trying other RF flavors soon, but as the picture shows, I'm trying to pretend to be a dainty eater.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This was my first time trying Biltong of any brand.  It is an affordable snack, and very enjoyable.  I hope to try the new flavors as they come out.Plus, how can you not love something called righteous felon. :D\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I have to admit at first I was a bit concerned with the cost of the 4 pack, but after getting it and trying it we are very happy with our purchase. The beef was so thinly sliced and each piece had a wonderful flavor. I have tried many types of \"jerky\" before and not super happy with the texture of it. The dried beef had such an awesome texture.Bottom line - you really do get what you pay for with this. As a farm family, we highly recommend it. My hubby has already asked me to get him some more - he loves being able to snack on it while out on his tractor.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Opened a package to a bunch of mold.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Yes, they're right - I will never go back to jerky as long as this is available. My father introduced me to jerky when I was 12 years old and visiting him in Elgin, IL (my parents were divorced). He brought me to a butcher shop where they made their own jerky and I sampled them all - and loved every one of them. Flash forward - I would buy jerky whenever I come across it (I'm now 79 years old) and still love it. However, I ordered this just to see if they were right and they were! This is great, more flavorful than jerky, easier to eat, not as hard, and thinner.  I've had all the flavors and they're all terrific.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The taste was great but my pieces were too small It is like the took the scraps from bigger pieces and put them in the bag! I am hoping the next bags will be better size wise.One last commit....You really have to love dried beef products to pay these kind of prices! And if you really want a shock, calculate the price per pound\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This biltong is amaaaaazing! This is the first time I've tried biltong. I mistakenly assumed it would be just like beef jerky, but I couldn't be more wrong. It's softer, more flavorful, and didn't get caught between my teeth like most jerkys can. It's not overly sweet or salty, and has just the right amount of flavoring. I will absolutely be purchasing this again!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I was expecting something a little more special. There is only a bit of difference between this and ordinary jerky. The package said that it would have a flavor like jerky with hints of prosciutto, and on that count, it delivers. I’m not entirely convinced that the higher price makes the subtle flavor difference worthwhile. That aside, it was a very tasty high quality snack.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This stuff is delicious! I got tired of super chewy, rubbery beef jerky and picked up a package of the Kalahari Original flavor biltong at a local store. I ate the whole thing in one sitting and thought “well, I can’t buy that stuff anymore” but then I read the nutritional info and BAM - it’s the perfect snack. I went back and bought more but then I got lazy and busy with a new job so I ordered this variety pack and my only problem is deciding which one to eat first. The flavor, texture and packaging are all very pleasing to me and I WILL purchase again.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  So I bit on the marketing of biltong as a \"better than jerky\" snack. Tastes like thin cut jack link beef chunks. I was hoping for a fancy beef jerky, not a thin sliced semi dry meat snack. noone in the family is a fan. unfortunately I bought the variety pack...cant hardly tell the difference between flavors\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Perhaps I was expecting a beef jerky-like taste but wow this was just gross. I have tried all kinds of jerky and thought this would be an alternative or higher end version of that but NO.... it had a gross medical like taste and no flavor at all. I spit it out and threw the remaining unopened packages in the garbage. No thank you! Yuck!!!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This a really good Keto snack. It's like a more sophisticated version of beef jerky. It's difficult to find jerky-like snacks that are Keto. Many have added sugars, so we were really happy to find this for my son who has been doing really well on Keto but has missed the normal snacks. We love that it's just a few simple ingredients which are all real foods/spices we recognize and not a bunch of chemical preservatives.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  We LOVE Biltong.  I got a craving for it this week and came to Amazon to order our favorite Biltong brand.  This Kalahari popped up on my search page and after reading reviews and info, decided to give it a try.  SO bummed.  This was the worst Biltong ever.  Hubby loves Garlic Biltong.  Thought I would surprise him, since he hasn’t had it in a few month and told him to close his eyes and open his mouth.  I put one piece of this in his mouth and he actually spit it out like a child.  He said, wtf is that, that is so disgusting.  I took a nibble.  Agree.  It was so vinegary and sour and vile.  Tried the original Biltong.  Outside of sour vinegar, no flavor.  Tried the spicy.  It was a powdery coating of nastiness, with no spice actually in the meat.  Can’t imagine we got a bad batch of 3 different flavors.  Must simply be this Biltong is just gross.  On top of that, a minor annoyance is the packaging.  It seems nice, but opening it is a pain.  The open notch is about an inch higher that the reseal zipper, so you end up ripping/tearing/chewing/cutting the bag to open it.  We threw away all of the Biltong, minus the 3 partial pieces we tasted (and spit out).  Luckily, I had also ordered several pounds of our favorite Biltong Superdtore/Biltong USA yummies, which arrived yesterday and brought us back to Biltong bliss.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n\\n  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Just got my package. Opened it and it was all moldy. Gross.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Fell in love with biltong after a trip to S Africa. Haven’t really seen it around where I live. So glad to have found this 3 pack. All three flavors are delicious & so incredibly better than jerky.  Peri peri might be my favorite but so hard to say because they’re all so yummy\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Being from South Africa, we crave biltong. This one had high enough ratings to give it a try. The first order was good. Garlic (decent garlic), peri peri (light chili but good enough), and traditional (tasted mostly traditional, only with less coriander and much more salt). Before a big road trip, I ordered more. Yuck! What happened?!?! The traditional flavored packet was way off. The meat was yellowish white and, thinking it was just extra sealed and seasoned, I gave it a try. Nope! It was off. The garlic packet was overly moist and smelled weird. My son ate most of it, then opted to give the rest to the dog. The peri peri packet was fine, but didn’t have much of a taste. So, no more for us, and definitely not at this price. So disappointed!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  It is not very good jerky either. The company claims it\\'s a great asset that it has no sugar. Fine, but I like little sugar, honey, maple, etc., in my jerky, ham, or bacon. Some might not; to each their own. They also claim that it is something like \"fine\" prosciutto, which is untrue; it lacks prosciutto\\'s umami. Biggest problems with a lot of jerky are being extremely tough and having way too much salt. This stuff is tough, and it has a lot of salt. They make it sound so good that I wanted to try it, but it is expensive, and I feel ripped off.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This product had a very strong organ meat flavor that was extremely unpleasant. It literally tasted like I was eating a less-than-fresh beef liver. As a result, I’m convinced that they are including organ meats into their recipe, which dramatically increases cholesterol. I’ve canceled all my future orders!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  With my work I sometimes feel lime am into intermittent fasting because my schedule is not a typical 9-5.When am swamped with clients,this became my go-to snacks.I was not into snacking beef jerky really.But when I read in Bobbi Brown's book Beauty on the Inside  that actress Olivia Munn snacks on beef jerky(before she became an investor on a beef jerky brand) and takes it with on trailer sets,travels because it keeps her body on track.And I am glad I found Kalahari Biltong's beef jerky and I can attest it does give me satiety.Its not just any beef jerky.Its texture is like a prosciutto.No sugar,paleo-friendly,nothing artificial 6 ingredients max!My fave is the Spicy Peri-Peri hands down.I stash it on my bag,its resealable,convinient.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Three members of my household tried all three \\'flavors\\' in this variety pack. All three were terribly dry, gray in color, and bitter. They were so bad we thought they might actually have been expired.. But we confirmed they were not past their expiration date. We couldn\\'t stand throwing all three, basically brand new bags, directly in the trash so we had a family friend try them who is also paleo and when they agreed we binned them.I understand this product is \"natural\" and doesn\\'t have added sugars and chemicals like other jerky products, but we are talking about seriously awful taste.I reached out to the company and they advised they aren\\'t responsible for how Amazon \"handles their product\"...So I guess if you are going to try this, don\\'t do it on Amazon because it will be the first excuse their customer service uses to explain why their product tastes so terrible.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  YUM! Kalahari Biltong, where have you been all my life? This tastes more like beef jerky than today's beef jerky tastes. The taste us all natural, with a drier made-by-nature consistency, instead of the gross preservative ridden slimy consistency of the over processed beef jerky today. This is what my family will be enjoying from now on. It not only was a hit with me, my husband, but also our daughter. Thank you for providing a tasty, healthy, natural product that fits well with our paleo/low carb lifestyle.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I was excited to try this, since it was something new. It's absolutely horrible. The original was the first bag to try. I could barely get passed a small piece. It tastes either like it's spoiled or something, I couldn't figure it out, but in the trash that went. Next was the garlic which was marginally better but not really. I'm being too kind there.I haven't opened the peri peri one and I don't think I want to.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  If you know and like South African Biltong, then this is the best on the market hands down!They used to only sell privately from North Carolina and shipping took a while to get to you. If you have had that Biltong craving, then you know you can't wait too long and must have it ASAP! Thank you Bleddie Lekker for selling on Amazon because now it arrives so much quicker! I sound like an advert for the product but I'm not. Anyone that has had that Biltong craving knows what I'm talking about - when you want it, you need to get it and you need it NOW :-)- Thanks guys for bringing RSA to the USA!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I’ve ordered from this brand before and I loved it. After living in the USA for the last 2.5 years I really missed biltong.I ordered it again and this order is the total opposite of my first experience - if you look at my photo you will notice the color is like a plum red - In all my years of eating biltong growing up in South Africa, I have never had biltong that is this color. And it looks wet as if it hasn’t been dried long enough.I don’t even want to taste it.Also no return policy which is frustrating. Waste of $21\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I was a little worried after reading other reviewers that said it was hard. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was soft and tasted fantastic. If I bought this in South Africa I would still think this was good biltong. The only downsides were that the price was very steep at $22 for a 1/2 pound (This product was selling for $13 in 2017 and $18 a few months ago), also thought it was a little bit too salty...but again it was great biltong and I ate the whole bag in about 10 minutes.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This will be my last purchase of this brand.  The chunks were under dried.  Tendons so chewy that a dog would have a difficult time eating it.  The taste no where near the original biltong I've had hand made from a guy that makes it here from scratch.  Tastes exactly like the regular Bledie Lekker I gave bad reviews to a little while ago.  I just wanted to give them another chance.  This is just corned beef with very little seasoning and under dried with the texture of eating a raw piece of goat.  Lol.  Ayoba yo is 10 times better.Edit Feb 22, 2020:It's a bit or miss.  I needed biltong real quick since I ran out of Ayoba yo so I just clicked on anything in my past orders and took a Gamble and ordered bleddie chunks.  Wow.  This one was ONO!  Still chewy with lots of tendons but it was tasty and not like my previous ones that was bland and chewy corned beef.  I will give them the benefit of the doubt and order 2 more.  I will let you know if it was a fluke.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  It\\'s just \"ok\", not great, but not terrible either. To be honest it\\'s a lot moister than I expected, I thought it would be  much drier. It\\'s not bad tasting, but the flavor is rather on the bland side, there\\'s no real impression of any particular \"flavor\" that pops out at you like salt or vinegar, which are the two top ingredients after beef, and the spices don\\'t add any discernible flavor at all that I can detect. More salt and/or vinegar flavor would definitely improve the taste of this stuff a lot IMO. Don\\'t get me wrong, this stuff isn\\'t bad, it\\'s chewy, and doesn\\'t appear to have much if any fat or gristle, which is good, but there\\'s just not enough flavor to set this apart from other Biltong products i\\'ve tried. I realize taste is a very personal matter, and different people like different flavors, but I don\\'t think I would purchase this product again.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Before, I had to kill my own wildebeast to get authentic South African jerky. Yesterday I culled my entire herd because I don't need them anymore.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The thickness, the consistency, the texture, and the crunchiness of the coriander made it resemble Biltong in the best way — what made it not as great was the lack of the vinegary flavor. And I realized that that is what I love about Biltong; the combination of salt, vinegar, coriander, and quality beef! If this Biltong has that vinegary flavor I crave and grew up with, it is near perfect!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I've ordered this now quite a few time. The chunk style is better than the shaved but that may just be my personal preference. I've been to SA several times and have a number of ex-pat friends that make delicious Biltong. EVERY single other company I've tried on the internet selling Biltong isn't even close to an authentic SA product.... but this stuff is pretty darn good. Flavor and texture are spot on. Everything else is dried like jerky and the flavor profile isn't close. I wish the pricing was a little better because I can kill a bag in 1 sitting so it's an expensive treat but everyone loves it.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Lekker man, lekker.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  As a South African, THIS is biltong.  Just the right amount of moisture - and nice and thickly cut too - so minimal wastage to bilton 'dust' that you get when it is too finely sliced.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Discovered this tasty, healthier-than-typical form of beef jerky replacement a few months ago and haven't stopped eating it since. This south african form of dried meat is air dried and far healthier than that Jack LInks or Umberto garbage you find in stores. Far less sodium and much better texture -- it's like prosciutto jerky.This particular brand if Biltong is tasty, but the bag is too big. You're supposed to eat it within 3-5 days of opening and that's simply not possible for a single person to do. I started buying Kalahari Biltong instead because it comes in individually sealed packages that are better for snacking.But bottom line is: if you want a healthier snack than typical beef jerky or worse, chips, etc., Biltong is where it's at!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I had high hopes for this jerky. The taste was “just ok!” It is dry and a little spicy.  The texture and size of the pieces was “very” inconsistent. Some of the product was shredded. Some pieces were the size of a quarter. Some pieces were the size of a golf ball. The flavor and texture was affected by this inconsistency. I would not recommend, nor purchase this jerky again. At $30 a pound, it was not a wise purchase.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I’ll start by saying I LOVE Biltong. My friend’s mom is from South Africa and made me some a few years back and I have been obsessed ever since. We don’t live close, which makes it hard for me to come up on some. This meat is intended to be enjoyed in nice juicy premium cuts and prepared with a nice spice seasoning and air-dried. In other words it’s like skirt steak slices preserved in a bag (but with South African seasoning). SO good. When I first came across this brand 2+ years ago. I was in LOVE. It wasn’t like homemade biltong, but it did the job. Where it fell short was being too thinly sliced and not “as” flavorful - though, it was juicy, nice and pink/red in the middle, and finely textured. However, I have purchased this 2-3x more since then and it has arrived dry EVERY time; and the pieces have been grainy... It’s about that time of year again where I’m feigning for some. I MAY give it one more try and this time return it if I get a bad batch (I usually don’t). Depending on the outcome, I’ll update the review and drop it to 2 stars or up it to 4.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The biltong we bought from them 2 years ago was much better. What happened? Lots of recent complaints. This was terrible. Extremely dry, nothing like South African biltong. More like jerky but for a much higher price. Bag was also filled with meat powder.  Won't buy from this company again.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I bought this a year back and have been trying to find it again, now it's back and I love this Biltong. I have a pack of each, love the Peri Peri!! I keep it in the car for road trips and have introduced my boys to Biltong! They love this stuff.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  As biltong should taste! And the peri peri spice is the right amount of spicy. We loved it and ordered more. Thank you\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I bought these to save money on the small packs but they were way more dry and salty than the other biltong packs I’ve bought. It’s still sitting in my fridge at work unfinished because of how poor the quality is\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Beef jerky has 7+g, BTW.There's a reason I subscribe!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I literally just put this in my dogs food dish as half of the bag was straight trash. No meat. Just chopped up garbage. I love biltong but this is not what you want.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  A bit on the dry side, not all that spicy. It’s alright, expected a lot more for the price. There’s a lot more better options for just $4-5 more/pound on amazon...\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  As an ex South African who is very fond of biltong and droewoers, I was extremely excited to trying this particular brand. I thought the flavor / taste was pretty authentic but was extremely disappointed in the contents of the package. The product is expensive but this would have been justified if I actually received proper slices of biltong. The package contents were about 50% slices biltong and the other 50% consisted of “biltong dust”  Please slice your biltong manually versus using an electric biltong slicer - it’s not pleasant paying for biltong sawdust/ powder.Update: I came home today and was surprised to find a package from Ayoba-Yo containing a replacement package(s) of biltong and a note from Wian explaining possible causes for the biltong fluff. I am extremely impressed with this company and their customer service. Needless to say, the biltong tasted great and the contents were plentiful and fluff free. They have certainly won me over with their customer service and I will not hesitate to order from them again and I am changing my original rating to 5 star\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I have been lucky to visit South Africa a few times in my life. What is not lucky is coming home to the United States and craving biltong. Biltong is a magical, sugar-free, barely processed jerky and once you try it, you will never want to eat American beef jerky again. Biltong made in South Africa cannot be imported to the States, which is probably the saddest thing ever. I have searched for the perfect recreation of what I have eaten while road tripping through the Karoo, and I haven't found anything that can match it. Until I got this Ayoba-Yo Biltong delivered to my door yesterday. My search is over. Ayoba-Yo is a match to the biltong in my memories. The meat is sliced thin and perfect for snacking. It is fresh, doesn't contain any gross preservatives, and the flavors are the perfect traditional blend. Try this biltong and make the switch, you won't be disappointed!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  My dad is from South Africa and has always told me how much he enjoyed biltong and how he misses it being in the U.S., so when I ran across this on Amazon.com I had to get him some. He absolutely loves it. Whenever I can\\'t figure out what gift to get him for Father\\'s Day or his birthday I order a few bags of this biltong and I always get a \"thank you\" call from him when it arrives.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Biltong is perfect for padkos* when you're on the go! You can also eat it while you're sitting at your desk at work. Or watching TV at home. Or outside while taking a hike.Although this is made in the USA, it is clearly authentic South African in flavour. Could I love it more? Maybe, if it were made of ostrich meat, but I'm guessing this is hard to come by on this side of the Atlantic. (If the manufacturer wants to make some venison biltong, I will be an official taste-tester. Just let me know - I will be right over. In six weeks, or however long it takes to your product.)* Snack that you eat in the car. Literally road food. (Not road kill.)** Really delicious.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  As someone who spent my childhood in Africa (1975-1987) I fondly remember the delicious food, especially biltong. I remember my brother and I trying to make some when I lived on a farm. We had friends who really knew how to make it and coriander was one of the main ingredients. This biltong has that flavor I loved.I also prefer this to jerky which is normally overly sweet. This has no sugar in it so may be different for most Americans. I don't think it is an acquired taste as much as it is a love of the spices used. What is different about this biltong is that it is sliced thin so it is easy to eat. When I was a child biltong was not sliced. But I think that is an improvement.I'm happy this is available at amazon so I can experience something from my childhood again. Sometimes you just want something savory, not sweet!~The Rebecca ReviewP.S. To compare this I ordered some other biltong that I used to order and I think this is better for me since it doesn't have the nitrites. Also has more spices. I love the coriander flavor of this biltong.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I have recently adopted a low carb, high protein diet combined with weight training, so I'm always looking for new sources of protein. I use protein powder as little as possible, and eat more from natural sources.I have a brand of beef jerky I really like, but traditional beef jerkies have a lot of sugar (10g protein to 6g of sugar). Biltong, however, has more protein per oz (16g) and 0g of carbs or sugar. Simple ingredients, and nothing funky. So a big win on the nutrition front.That is great, but what won me over was the flavor. It has a nice hearty flavor, and has a little wetness to it that makes the texture nice to chew. I have tried another brand of biltong, but I found it too dry for my taste (kinda of like chewing on plastic). So another win on flavor and texture.Pricing is okay. Good beef jerky is not cheap, so you get what you pay for. I would like to buy in bulk, so bigger packages with better discounts would be a good offer I would jump on immediately.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  It's good to be home! Finally, someone has managed to make good quality biltong just like they do in South Africa. I'm really glad that I stumbled across Ayoba-yo biltong when a friend of mine hosted a party at his house.  I love beef jerky, but this is even better. It's healthy with natural ingredients and is my go-to snacks when watching my team play. Go Bokke!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This is very similar to Bosnian “suho meso,” which is smoked beef. I think the flavor in this package is pretty good. However, the slices are very tiny, I would prefer larger slices. There is little tid bits and it gets annoying trying to gather all the little pieces. This is much better than jerky, which I hate. Jerky is much tougher and even the sugar free jerky is overcome with pepper taste. This beef is not tough and not bad in taste, but it is pretty salty.  It is pretty expensive for 4oz.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I was expecting this to actually taste like biltong.I grew up in South Africa and this is definitely not good. Not even as good as the supermarket biltong one gets over thereThe biltong tasted like the plastic it was packed in. No flavor, even the texture was odd.Amazon does sell the real thing. Look act the Carnivore Meat company products if you want to taste decent biltong.I will never buy this brand again,\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I've tried a bunch of these new American brands and none of them are that good. They taste nothing like what I ate while living in Africa and most of them have tasted dominantly like vinegar, which is useful as a preservative, but isn't a pleasant taste. BUT THIS BRAND...so far, is the best. The cuts are nice (not tiny shredded bits like some brands), the taste of vinegar is very light, and you can taste the beef.  If you want to check out biltong, THIS BRAND is a good place to start.Personally, I still prefer plain dried jerky from Robertson's in Oklahoma and Texas. Their jerky is more like the simple biltong that I ate in Africa, though the latter were very thick cuts of beef. Robertson's is just a delicious traditional oldschool American jerky (no sugary or vinegar taste, very light on salt, and very dry) made of large thin cuts of beef.  I'm thinking about visiting their homestore as a pilgrimage of a sort.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I liked the brand as it seemed like a great product at a great price, but found that almost half our package was brown/green sticks that smell horrible. Pay attention before you bite, so disappointed.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I have ordered these in the past and loved them, but the last box I ordered was mangled at the top (as if opened). No biggie, but then I opened my first beef stick and was horrified to find it a rather greenish color and a pungent taste. I spit it out and am throwing the box away and don't plan to order these again.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This is a very good product, but the price fluctuates drastically, going from about $26 to $48 per 24 count box in just one week. The price currently is $37, making me think there is very little consistency. If they’d keep the price steady and low, I’d buy them regularly, but it varies so much, I feel like they must be ripping people off.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  These are by far the best beef sticks, in regards to quality and taste. Country Archer has done their job here. However this is a price point I just can't agree with, sorry. As good as they are, I can gladly live without them..I've tried quite a few other beef sticks (including everyones childhood favorite slim jims) more recently but the 'others' and even the original aren't a healthy alternative (in terms of a stick of beef, yes I know).. As well as just the taste is always off with them.. So I found these from Costco, ordered some more here because I just wanted to.. .. now I'm guilt riddled questioning myself as to why would I spend so much on a silly pack of beef sticks? Maybe I'd buy more if the price wasn't so unsavory. I think them claiming these as some sort of 'keto' or 'paleo' thing is just 100% marketing, and used as a means to jack up the price further as if it's a special dietary supplement - and that's just unfortunate. I'd bet these would sell (even) better with a more rational pricing.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I can't eat sugar, soy, or wheat, which are usually in all beef jerky. So I was happy to find these on Amazon, (found first at Academy). They taste great and it's all good clean ingredients! Perfect for keto, paleo, or someone like me with a multitude of allergies! The price equals I think $1.29 each with subscribe and save. Not that that's cheap, but you'd probably pay the same for a same size beef jerky at the checkout at walmart and it would be full of trash ingredients. So, I'm not complaining. :D I'll keep buying them as long as Amazon keeps the price good!!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Used to love this product.  Not with the new “Colored Beef Collagen Casing” it leaves a red stain on the packaging and anything else that comes into contact with the casing or left over packaging.  Too bad they used to be the best but all the beef flavors have this new casing and the taste is honestly not as good either.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  These are fantastic.  Peppery hot and delicious.  Some beef sticks are hot without flavor.  These are a mixture of great taste and mild to mid-level heat.  The heat does not last forever.  It's a pleasant transient aftertaste I enjoy.Perfect as a snack.  Even as a meal-replacement.  No garbage in them.  They are a high quality food product.  I just wish they were cheaper.  That said, they are worth the cost.Plus, if you are prepping for some new tyrannical COVID lockdowns, you could do MUCH worse than these delicious beef sticks.  Great source of protein.  Portable.  Sealed.  Last long.Buy these and get your beef on.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Well, it's a beef stick. It has little flavor and the casing is sort of tough and chewy. It also looks sort of gross because it's whitish and just looks like a piece of skin when you bite it. It must be uncured so if that's what you're after, great. If you're looking for more of a tasty item like you'd normally expect from a beef stick, look elsewhere.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  LOVE this jerky! No sugar added + natural without MSG or other nasty additives is super hard to find without making your own. I caught these at Costco (the bag of mini sticks) & they didn’t last long, both myself & 5yr old loved them. I had to get more. They’re the perfect snack/lunch on the go, post workout, traveling on flights too. I can’t be without them. Have them on subscribe & save.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I like to have some protein-forward snacks around. Meat sticks in general are a great option and I've tried many. The taste of these is great but the texture is a big off. A little too mushy for my taste. I like a good firm meaty stick.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Hi,I bought this for the office to give it a try. Our office bought vegan jerky (yuck). So, I mentioned I had heard about this stuff on a podcast (spittin\\' chiclets - not a big deal). Figured I would give the stuff a shot. I had about 6 people in the office try it and we all agreed it was delicious. It tastes good, and is not nearly as \"leathery\" as other beef jerky. You get a fair amount in each bag too.If this was something I could buy a bit cheaper in a larger quantity I would probably have it on hand more often. I\\'ll look for it in stores and occasionally buy more of it. Someone notify me when I can get a few more bags at a bit cheaper price.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Spittin Chiclet's Podcast fan here. First heard about Boikey's during Tim Stapleton's initial visit to the pod. Tim is a natural storyteller and his interview goes down as one of the best ever on SC. Anyways, fast forward a few months, I get on YouTube, I see a Boikey's commercial featuring Paul Bissonnette, one of SC pod hosts. A few firsts came out of the commercial for me.  First time watching a YT commercial in full length, first time crying in laughter from watching a commercial, first time a commercial made me want to purchase the item, immediately....and I am a vegan!!! (just kidding). After collecting myself from watching the commercial, I login into my Amazon account and ordered a pack of Boikey's in traditional flavor. This stuff is great. No seriously, awesome. Take a look at the ingredients from some of the more well-known brands you see at the market. 90% of the ingredients sounds like they come from a bio-waste plant than a place were food is made. The ingredients contained within Boikey's stuff doesn't require a degree in Chemical Engineering or Latin to know what it is. It's all simple and natural ingredients, most 10-years will know what they ingredients are. So what does it translate into taste? Awesome and flavorful jerky....seriously. It's a little expensive for what it is, but like with most things in the world, you get what you pay for. This is no bargin-bin supermarket special. It's some quality jerky. I have no regrets and will continue to buy more. Tim....hope you continue to stop by the SC pod and I suggest your next venture is to bottle up Russian Gas and get it on Amazon.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  While Boikey's marketing folks clearly decided to promote their product as a healthy, active-lifestyle alternative to beef jerky, I'm here to tell you something else: this is the highest quality South African-style biltong I've found in the U.S. -- and I've been looking for 30 years.  Thin-sliced, wonderfully tender, a perfect level of moisture and, best of all, an authentic blend of spices with subtlety and depth. Yes, it's slightly overpriced, though good biltong can't be cheap. Yes, I wish they made slightly larger envelopes and sold it in mixed-flavor three-packs. And no, they didn't send me any free samples -- though I wish they would!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I will say that Stapleton is right, this is way better than almost any jerky I've ever had.. and I've tried a lot. The flavor of the beef really comes thru. It's kinda like a dried Beef Carpaccio that you would get at a fancy Italian restaurant. Based on taste and texture alone, I would be devouring these at warp speed. However, I am not rich and they are about $7.50 a serving. That's whether you get it here from Amazon, or use the BIZ20 swipe up code on the Biokeys main website.  That's a hefty price in my opinion, so I won't be able to eat them as much as I'd like. Of course, price is relative to income, so if you've got it.. or you don't and just want to spend it anyway.. I highly recommend these.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I spent a couple of years in South Africa and I totally forgot the taste of biltong. This stuff is so delicious. I wish it would come in bigger quantities, but it’s probably good that it doesn’t because I would be eating The whole bag for regardless of how much came in it.  Super soft and super tasty. Thank you!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Flavor and texture are great. Dry like you'd want a jerky to be while not being tough or too chewy. The pieces are cut small for easy snacking. Will definitely purchase again.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  REALLY YUMMY! Definitely on the pricier side, though. Out of 3 bags all of mine were in excellent condition, no quality issues that some other reviewers had.Also, a little more on the crumbly side, not many big pieces. More like jerky trail mix if that makes sense.I wish the bags were resealable like other jerkys. Of course you could use a clip or rubber band or whatever, but I dont have that kind of self control and forethought. So I ended up eating each bag in one go; not exactly difficuly, but at close to $10 a pop, felt a bit extravagant for a snack.Overall, a delicious snack and would love to buy in bigger packs that offer more value like a lot of jerky brands do.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This is more expensive than other biltong or jerky products, and I don't think it's quite worth the extra expense. To me it tastes quite raw, reminiscent of steak tartare, and I do not like raw meat. I have not had this problem with other brands of biltong or jerky, so I will continue to buy the other brands and not this one.  It is not going to waste, however. I chop it up, saute it in a pan with some chopped onion, and add scrambled eggs which, of course, takes away the raw meat taste.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Ok I’m not big on jerky and stuff but these were ok, my other half likes them a lot more then me so they didn’t go to waste. I really only tried them cause Tim Stapleton is awesome and yeah as someone not big on this type of stuff all together this wasn’t bad. But I loved seeing Tim Stapleton on Spittin chicklets it was fantastic (worth checking out) but he makes a good product and I have to say it was really good with a pink Whitney *wink* lolz but def give these a try\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Sooooo good!! As a South African who grew up eating biltong, I have to give my stamp of approval. I’ve converted my American son, and he can’t get enough. I LOVE the packaging. Flavor is spot on.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  A string of recent past reviews (around April 2020) reported mold, suggesting a bad batch. I contacted the manufacturer and they said it was a packaging problem, and should be fixed now. I ordered a bag (in June) and it was fine, so the bad batch is probably gone now.My partner likes the flavor a lot, and has an unusual allergy (paprika) that rules out most other brands of biltong or jerky. I find the flavor so-so.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I must have gotten a bad bag of jerky. That is all I can figure from all of the reviews. I can't chew through any of this stuff. There is so much gristle in it, I have to spit it out after gnawing on it for several minutes. The taste is a bit gamey and to boot, it's ineligible to return. I am not sure who to contact to return and get a refund. There is no contact information from Amazon. Buyer beware if you are unhappy with the purchase. It's ineligible for return. This jerky ain't cheap either. Stryve was much better and very tender. I assumed Brooklyn Biltong would even be better. My suggestion would be to try a smaller sample size before buying a big bag of something you may regret buying. I bought their steakhouse smaller bags and they were fine, this was awful.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Moldy product I have purchased this several times and love it but last shipment was not up to snuff tasted off then noticed mold. GrossSecond shipment in a row with moldy product.  Disgusted at quality control and will no longer purchase this brand again.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I have tried several brands of Biltong, and settled on one brand. But, they have been out of stock and are a bit pricier than I like (they charge for shipping as well). I just had the bare-naked flavor from Brooklyn Biltong and it is excellent. Very tender (I hate dry, chewy jerky), and a nice beef flavor. I'm likely to convert. :)\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I placed my first order recently and had an issue.  I emailed the company and not only were they fast to respond but they more then atoned for the initial issue.  Not only was I impressed with the personable customer service but the product tastes great.  I do recommend refrigerating the product for the best flavor which is what this product is packed with.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I may have just got a one off bag but mine had a huge clump in the middle that was pretty solid and very very fatty. The meat other than that is excellent, great flavor and texture - you can tell its quality meat. I'll give it another try, probably the peri peri next time. First impression is I was a bit disappointed but I'll definitely try another batch.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  An update on the below. Ben from Brooklyn Biltong reaches out to me after seeing my initial review, and offered to replace my bag.I took him up on it, and to reduce mold risk, have stored the bag in my meat & cheese drawer with my salami etc. The product has stored well and continues to hit the spot.Thanks again Ben for the fast follow up and great customer service.————The product got moldy only a few weeks after opening. This while always being sealed up and in an apartment where the average humidity was around 30% (low).If it needs to be kept in the fridge after opening, it should be labeled as such!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I\\'ve tried their other flavors and found them to be a little salty for my taste. I like the texture, I like the overall concept of biltong, and I like the ingredient list. This \"flavor\" (I say it in quotes because it\\'s just plain) is fantastic and a new staple in my work bag.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Have bought Brooklyn Biltong many times, frequently directly from the store. This was the first time buying this flavor/packaging - not sure what happened but it was covered in mold two days after I opened it. Best to store it in the fridge or buy smaller packages.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I’ve had this in my ‘Covid closet’ since February and just went to get it (it’s now June 5). I opened it and it’s covered with mold. Isn’t dried jerky supposed last pretty much indefinitely?? Very disappointed especially with how much it costs.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I've bought the Bledie Lekker biltong before, and it's fantastic - I can't recommend it highly enough.  This product unfortunately isn't anywhere near the same level.  The meat is dry, crumbly, and almost flavorless.  If this is how droewors are supposed to be, I'll pass.  Considering the price, I would have been better off buying a package of beef jerky at the local gas station.Other reviewers have commented that it's hit or miss - some droewors are great, and others are like the ones I received.  However, I've bought several packs of their biltong, and they've all been the same high quality, so from now on I'll stick with that.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I was so excited to find this product. I was born in Durban and miss the flavor of home. But this product is so disappointing. It is so dry and tough that you can barely chew through it. I gave it to my dogs! The flavor is wonderful but if I try to chew on this, I will break a tooth. Maybe I just got a bad batch but there’s no place to reach out to the company with feedback on their website or social media and no returns allowed so I guess this I was just a very expensive mistake. I suggest you try a different brand.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This stuff tastes absolutely fantastic. My only problem is I can't stop eating them and they are kind of expensive. Hands down my favorite meat snack.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Love the straight regular Biltong these guys sell 5 Stars for that - it is the best in the USA (this coming from a South African ex-Pat that has tried 15 different versions).I'm just not a fan of the Dried Wors (Dried Borewors). I find it has too much fat so stick with the best Biltong I can find.Great company though and they ship fast which is a plus because when you get that Biltong craving, it is all you think about :-)\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Uhhhhhh.  I'd rather order Ayoba yo droewors.  Way better in texture and flavor.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  As a few others have stated in the reviews, the quality of this product really varies from bag to bag and I think it has to do with how old they are. The last bag I had was unreal... The perfect combination of moisture, flavor and fat.... Really a great representation of what SA droewors tastes like.... but I would say more than 50% of the bags I've purchased are not that way... They are a lot drier which kills the flavor and texture... The product almost becomes bitter. Still better than a pepperoni stick but I can't give it 5 stars with the quality variations.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I've dried all the droëwors on Amazon, and this stuff is definitely the best.  Like all droëwors, it's not exactly the same every time, but every bag I've had has been really good.  The other brands available have been ok, but not as good as this stuff!  The name is definitely accurate!  I'll be buying more, and more....\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Unfortunately, this Droewors does not qualify as Bleddie Lekker” (= Damn Good/Tasty).But it is “Pretty” or “Quite” Good in my opinion.As an experienced taster/eater of both Droewors and Biltong, it seems that this particular product needs more spices, especially Coriander; a spice that is the key to genuinely tasty (and genuinely South African) Droewors.Fortunately, there are other tasty Droewors products available on Amazon.com.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  As someone who is stuck on a military base at AIT, you need to find food that is interesting to make your life a little more than the pure monotony it is most of the time. I was browsing for such snacks, found these and in a whim I ordered them. When it finally showed up, I shared with my roommates and we all really enjoy them! The texture was great and the flavor was fantastic! About the only downside is that it is a bit on the pricy side. Will definitely order again in the future!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Great flavour, terribly overpriced. We’ll be making our own in the future. There was hardly any in the bag.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I just had my second order arrive in the last week. Best bang for the buck. If you're addicted to beef jerky and like spice, this is hands down the best deal. I'm not proud by any means of ordering 2.5 lbs of this beef jerky in the last week. Beef jerky is high is sodium, but the heat and flavor of this beef jerky, I'm ready to meet an early death for. I get there are $40 12 ounce packages of designer jerky on the internet. Go for it, but if you're addicted to delicious and spicy beef jerky, this is that easy fix. Just enough heat that you can go through a bag in a couple hours, not so much that your stomach will churn in anguish. Also just enough spice to keep my girlfriend from eating any. Her stupid dog still wants some though. Anyway, great value $20 for 18 ounces and perfectly meets the spice I crave without giving me stomach ulcers, but potentially hypertension down the road.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I love beef jerky and love spicy hot food. I love the Jack Links Jalapeño and Hot N Sweet flavors so I tried the Wild Heat and it sucks. Yes it’s jerky and yes it’s hot, but it’s heat without flavor. I feel like I wasted my money. It’s ghost pepper hot so you can only eat a few pieces and it’s really just blah on the palette.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  First off, I have ordered numerous shipments of Jack Links jerky from Amazon and have received terrific products every time. I've never had any issues with packaging or freshness. Now, I love adding hot sauce to regular jerky to turn up the heat (e.g. Wicked's Reaper or Blair's After Death). I was pleasantly surprised that Wild Heat jerky packs a nice punch. The flavor is great and the heat is legit. It's not on the same level as the hot sauces but it's darn close. If you're looking for a version to make your mouth tingle, this is a great option. Definitely hotter than the Jalapeno or Sweet and Hot options, and I will be ordering again. Thanks Jack Links!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I love Beef Jerky.  At my advanced age...I have to be careful ofhard or \"inedible\" jerky pieces that can hurt my teeth.Jack Links brand is \"tooth friendly\"....good chewable jerky.So...I like heat...sweet and hot is good...but THIS \"Wild Heat\"intrigued me..so I gave it a try.Wow.  Very hot...Very very hot...but enough flavor tostand up to the heat.Heat index : \"Hot...seconds of \"too hot\"....followed byah...subsiding....followed by...gimme another bite\"Bottom line:  Hot hot jerky...not hard...a few pieces is enoughheat to bring you back for more...but later...not right now.20 bux for 2 9 oz bags....good jerky value.Lastly....NOBODY could eat 1/4 of a bag...and not cry regret for an hour.If you like hot jerky...try it...it might be just what you wanted....- Customer Cool 10/26/2020\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Has a creeping heat, probably from pepper extract, to give it a slow burn.  Not too hot, would turn off someone who doesn't like spicy food though.It has that quality of food made with superhot peppers or pepper extract where it isn't too hot in the mouth, but just a few pieces will make my stomach hurt and bathroom time not fun.The flavor is absolutely terrible here; I can't pinpoint what it is, but it tastes familiar, like overcooked, spicy ribs.  It has grown on me a bit, I ended up giving the other bag away.The quality of the jerky was very good though, just gross flavor and made with pepper extract that doesn't really heat up your mouth, it just hurts your guts\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Since we live in a small town, we'd been missing a good hot beef jerky. The jack link's wild heat was tender, with a slow to kick in heat, but the heat does arrive. Love this jerky, my new favorite.  Was also packaged in a separate box to protect.Update: reordered, tender and hot, I love it.On my 3rd order, the wild heat was chewy/tough. Not sure if I'd buy again.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I\\'ve been having a hard time finding Jerky that is spicy in stores. I bought this trusting the reviews,  it\\'s ok to me. I can definitely taste the pineapple \"powder\" that is listed in the ingredient list. Not a fan of that. I taste the sweetness as well from the sugar and definitely not a fan of that either. Overall the heat in this isn\\'t so FIRE. I\\'ll be looking for another brand/heat jerky after finishing this.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I LOVE spice. I love jalepano\\'s on everything. I use serrano peppers in a lot of my dishes. But this stuff was just tooooooooooooooooooooooo hot! It actually makes you sneeze just opening the bag. It tastes ok, but then about 20 seconds later, you wish you hadn\\'t eaten it. I bought two bags about 4 months ago and haven\\'t finished either. I offer it to people and they\\'re like \"oh wow, this is good, then....oh wow, NO MORE FOR ME THANK YOU!\"\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I love spicy food but this jerky is just awful. All heat, no flavor. 0/10 will never buy again. It did, however, have the traditional texture and freshness of Jack Links\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Holy God in heaven and earth these things are spicy. I was a bit skeptical about trying this brand and this flavor that I've never seen in our local stores. I tried the peppered and the sweet and spicy and even tried a jalapeño one and I have to say this is the spiciest of them all. The flavor is great and the price is really good. This will make a great stocking stuffer for those lovers of jerkies and spicy.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Wow, this is delicious!  I was looking for a beef jerky with no sugar.  Thought I would give this a try, I had never heard of this product before. It arrived today and I dug in. I will never buy beef jerky at the store again! What a difference! It actually looks like real meat! It’s soft and not like eating a chunk of leather!  It’s thinly sliced and seasoned perfectly. The flavor is great Which just goes to show you don’t need chemicals and sugar for jerky to taste fantastic!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I felt I found the perfect mid day KETO snackI couldn’t wait for it to get hereWhen it can it was such small pieces 25% it was like meat powder, the largest chunk in the bag was the size of a quarter stick of gunWish I had a better experience\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Kalahari is the real deal, as good as Braaitime, making the two best American biltong brands I've tasted.  If you can't get deer biltong (which you can't), there's nothing better than thin-sliced beef made from the original South African recipe.  I dare you not to eat the whole bag at once.  If you think it's expensive, try making your own. You want the most tender beef and it shrinks to at least half its original weight, so by the time you've spent days of labor on it, you can see why the Kalahari biltong is well worth the price.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I grew up in South Africa and have always loved loved LOVED good biltong.Recently, I have been craving biltong, but never thought twice about purchasing it on Amazon. After doing some research and reading a lot of reviews, I decided to purchase a 3 pack of Kalahari Biltong.I finished all 3 packs in about 3 days (This required A LOT of self restraint!)The meat is a little drier than what I would like, but I've always liked moist biltong, so that's just personal preference. The spices of the biltong is spot on. So yum!!I will definitely be making a purchase again soon! (I just wish it were a liiiiittle bit cheaper... oh well..)\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  In all honesty I've not opened the little precious parcel of very sought after biltong. We are ex-South Africans who appreciate this delicacy. We've just moved to California and are hoping to make our own batch as soon as the weather is favourable. As this was quiet an expensive purchase, I'm saving it for my husband as a Christmas treat!! From what I could smell after opening the envelope, it should be very yummy (right mix of spices) ! You seemed to have gotten the recipe right! (This coming from a farm girl who used to make their own batches of biltong throughout the year.)\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  We've tried a few different brands of biltong.  While I'm not a huge fan, my husband really enjoys the taste. I prefer traditional jerky, whereas this is a softer, chewier texture. My husband prefers this to the tougher jerky, and he feels this is by far the tastiest of the brands we've tried.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I got this for my son, as he has sensory issues and autism and will only eat certain foods. Beef jerky is very much his favorites, but everyone in the family had a chance to try bill tong, which is sort of like beef jerky but way better for you. We all enjoyed this very much, as it isn’t hard to chew at all, has a great flavor and is also high in protein. We are also working on a gluten free diet for my son and this biltong is gluten free, soy free, and has no sugar! Which I love because most kids want sugar snacks and they get very hyper and hard to deal with lol. I’m overall very happy with my purchase and would recommend this product! Will also be buying more in the near future. On a side note, biltong has only 6 ingredients, and their beer is raised with no added hormones and no antibiotics! Great right ? At least when you open a bag of billing you won’t have to worry about anything, it’s a healthy snack, and great for on the go too!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I'm fairly certain that the packs I received are spoiled. First time opening they smelled like vomit. Also, you will need scissors to open them, the tear slits on the sides do nothing and trying to open them is a battle. The struggle could be a possible warning about the vomit smell. It recommends you ear them within 2-3 days of opening but the smell was from my first opening of the pack. Also 6oz. is very small for the cost\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Product came promptly and packaged as expected.  Product tasted horrible.  Thought I should try a second taste the next day (all those glowing reviews).  Product tasted horrible.  Threw away.  Will not order again.  Would not recommend product.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I have tried every major brand of biltong you can find on Amazon and this is by far the saltiest. I've tried washing the biltong and squeezing the salt out with hot water. That basically rehydrates the meat, making it similar to what you'd get in a stir fry. But even after 10 straight minutes of doing this, the meat retains so much salt, I cannot handle it. And I am someone who loves salt. I've been known to pile on soy sauce onto Chinese takeout, yet this product is too much for me. That's how salty it is. The cuts of meat they use are otherwise good and far less fatty than other brands, so it's a shame that they ruin this product by making it inedible.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  If you're the kind of person who eats a pound of biltong a week, this might be good for you. I ordered a pound of the peri-peri for myself and a pound of the original for my sister--we live in different places, so they were in two different environments; both of us carefully kept the packages sealed except for the moments when they were actually in use, and for both of us, the packages went moldy after about a week. (Mine lasted maybe 12 days before the mold showed up; hers was 9.)I've never had biltong go moldy on me, but then, I've never had a pound of it at once. So I don't know how common this is. But I do know we didn't get our money's worth.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I was really excited to try Brooklyn Biltong. I actually did research on the best beef jerky and this was on several lists. Have to say... more than a little disappointed. First, the flavor was just off. It is almost bitter in flavor. Second, there is a spice blend on the jerky that 'sits' on the jerky that makes it feel... gritty? (see picture) and prohibits the smoke from coming thru. Finally, many of the pieces are hard and inedible. Three of the four pieces pictured were not edible because of how hard they were.  This was consistent in each of the three bags.... Hard and unable to chew.Again, wanted to really like this stuff but just didn't deliver\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I ordered this product only to discover that the jerky had mold on it. Three packages had mold, two of them completely covered in mold. This is unacceptable and disgusting.  Company has a no return policy.  Buyer be aware. The package arrived sealed and still had mold on it.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Product arrived moldy even though the expiration date ok.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  The meat was very tender.  It was not too small.  I have never had the biltong before and was not disappointed. It had lots of flavor.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This have a nice Peri Peri spice to an already tender jerky or biltong.  The heat sneaks up on you but great flavor and a satisfying snack.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Had mold on or some kind of growth,GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Enjoyed very much.  Great for backpacking.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I love that this is grass-fed beef and has simple ingredients. Great flavor and texture. Will be purchasing again soon.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I bought the original flavor and enjoyed it, I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors as well\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I normally don’t like to write negative reviews, but being from SA, this is personal.Way too salty. Texture off. Dry.  Crumbly. Smell not right. Grass fed?moldy ~ Took one bite and immediately felt an allergic reaction and my ears/sinuses clogging up.Voortrekkers buried in the Orange Free State are rolling over in their graves.~ recipe calls for more love.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This stuff was great until.....I discovered a long hair in the bag.  Gross.  I work in the food distribution business and this should never happen if proper precautions are taken.  This is very disappointing because the first serving out of the bag tasted good!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I love the taste of this, it reminds me of Australia, I don’t eat American beef jerky anymore, it’s horrible my taste is totally changed from living in Australia. There’s no sugar in it which I love, and the ingredients are really good with the use of sea salt instead of regular salt. It’s also grass fed which I love, the only thing is there’s a lot of crumbs in the bag, the last one I ordered was almost half crumbs , not edible crumbs, I might buy it again for the third or fourth time, but if it’s crumbs I’m going to return it. I called Amazon last time and they did refund me for this even though it says no returns. So don’t be afraid to order it, and you can call them if you have any issues.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Open the bad and then ate half of the bag in less then 10 minutes. look down and im like i really need to put this away. Move it acrross the room and next thing i know the bag is gone.. Damn i want more. Wish it was a little lower in price. But man for the quality and the taste of the product. Hands down best jerky i have ever eaten before. The best part is you can taste every seasoning in the product its just meat and salt\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Superb quality. Always sliced nicely and fresh. Of all the ones I have tried (you name it, I have tried it), this is also the best value. What I noticed with most other biltong offerings (Bull and Cleaver is one example), is they are all from Braaitime and repackaged/rebranded for the company who's selling it. From what I can tell Brooklyn Biltong does indeed do their own biltong which makes a huge difference. I am guessing it's lower yield but higher quality of biltong.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  If you’re South African and know real biltong don’t buy this. It is the worst I’ve tried here.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  First time I tried this brand, and I was super pleased... Not only because of the taste (savory and tender), but also because of the superb customer service I received when there was a slight mix up with my order. These guys really stand behind their product and I got the sense that they really have a passion for their craft. Highly recommended! And if you're new to Biltong, you can't go wrong with this one. Enjoy!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  The first time I purchased this product, I loved it.  Only a few brands of biltong have low sodium level as this one. This brand is much cheaper than another popular brand. Yet, the second time, I was very disappointed: a good amount of the meat didn't seem to be dried enough and lumped together. Look at the picture I uploaded, all the fat tissues! Is the company growing so fast that it is letting product quality slip?\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  My wife is usually crazy about this brand. This bag delivered in mid-August had a new funky aroma and tasted a little different. No idea why she ate it anyway, or why I tried a piece when she told me I should. Both of us got a scratchy mouth/throat within a minute or two of trying it - a mild anaphylactic allergic reaction. We didn't get sick or anything, and it didn't smell or taste like meat that was actually rotten, but something was WAY off with this and we aren't going with this brand any more.I get why you can't return food products to Amazon, but in a case like this there should really be a mechanism to get a refund...\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Disappointing :(I'd tried the Peri Peri flavor and really loved it.  Perfect amount of seasoning, and a nice texture...moist and chewy.I wanted to spread the Brooklyn Bitlong love and bought some to share with friends.  But since they don't like as much spice, I decided to get the Jo'burg Steakhouse flavor, figuring it would be all of the goodness with less of the heat.But it was dry and powdery, instead of moist and chewy. And it is way way too salty - there was no taste of garlic or vinegar or other tanginess...or beef...all that came through was salt.  The overwhelming saltiness was surprising, since according the the label the Steakhouse version has less sodium (240 mg) than the Peri Peri version (390 mg)  and that one was nowhere near as salty.  I do wonder if something went wrong in the production process.I'll wind up using it on salads or tossing into stir fries, etc where saltiness and a protein boost is welcome.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  After being unable to find shredded beef jerky chew in stores around me I turned to amazon.  In the past I’ve always gotten Wild Bills which I love.  But the price to order it from amazon was absurd.  This was the best price for shredded jerky so I went for it.  It’s rather disappointing.  It’s shredded down into almost a sawdusty powder.  A little too shredded for my liking.  And the taste is just okay.  Basically if you can afford it, get Wild Bill’s.

Not a big fan.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I'm so glad I stumbled upon Braaitime while looking for a good deal on biltong. The free shipping hooked me, and the taste locked me in for life. Some may call biltong and droewors an acquired taste, in which case I recommend starting to acquire it pronto.  I grew up in South Africa, have tried several of the American biltong brands, and found Braaitime the best. I had never tried droewors (dry sausage) before, but seeing how good the biltong was I ordered a sample of the droewors. I didn't think anything could be as good as the biltong, but wow! it is not hard or greasy but is easy to bite into, and the traditional flavor has a delicate spicy taste. I promptly ordered a pound to go along with my pound of biltong. I switched to biltong for a healthy lean protein snack to avoid cookies and to get leaner myself, and it's working (but this is not a diet review). I think the end result is so good because they don't rush the preparation but let it develop the flavor and tenderness slowly to perfection, as well as starting with the best beef. Also they keep it simple, focusing on doing a few things right rather than having dozens of confusing choices. Moreover, the quality of the customer service matches that of the product. I always get mine in two days via USPS priority mail, but they do not ship when weekend or holiday delays would adversely affect the meat.Great taste, nice and moist, no fatty aftertaste!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  These are my favorite snack since they\\'re high in protein and not that high in calories since it\\'s mostly lean beef used. The spice mixture in this is a bit heavy handed with clove so if you like the taste of clove then you\\'ll definitely love this. The lamb casing gives it an awesome \"snap\" when you bite into it. Here\\'s a cost saving tip: if you go to the company\\'s website, it\\'s actually cheaper to order it directly from them (and they have free shipping) so if you\\'re a fan of these like I am then it makes more sense. A 16 ounce bag (or 1 lb) costs $25 on the company\\'s site with free shipping and it gives you the option of buying the regular ones or the spicer version (peri peri). And the peri peri ones aren\\'t sold on Amazon (well, not from this company at least). So, if you try these out and find yourself addicted to them, then order directly from the company\\'s site.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I buy this for my husband who first tried it in South Africa when we were visiting family there.  The droewors I buy here is just as good, according to him.  Tastes like home.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Living in an area where dried beef, jerky and various game meats that are smoked or otherwise cured, This along with Biltong is a real great change of pace.  does not have a smoked taste, and if you crave that sort of snack move on.  Berks County Pennsylvania is ground zero for smoked meats of all kinds, from sausage to deer balogna it doesn't get any better than to love around these parts.  This stuff is addictive eat it, without getting heartburn.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Absolutely delicious pure meat snack. Spices and salt are really all you need, no added sugars. I got into Droewors Biltong so decided to try these too, and they're if possible even more delicious. There's more fat in the sausage than in Biltong slices.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  It’s not exactly the Namibian droewors I miss so much, but it’s a damn fine substitute!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I have been buying this product for ages and love the taste of home …. my last batch tasted like old socks and resembles American jerky sticks … no snap and a very disappointed me …..\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I’ve eaten this brand before and it was ok; good enough for someone desperately craving some droewors. This time it was so gross that I couldn’t swallow more than a couple bites. My partner could eat it either. It’s gone in the trash. Not worth the money, I would have thrown up had I kept eating it.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  If you are South African or know what real Droewors can taste like then do not buy this. It has so much fat in it that the flavour is completely masked. yes, I know droewors is super fatty but usually that makes it juicy and tasty. something went terribly wrong here. Very sad as I don't know where else to find it overseas.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Great quality, obviously no nitrates (not pink) good taste, reminds me of good German dry sausage.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  BEFORE YOU BUY!!The last 2 times I ordered this productThey only sent me 1 bag instead of 3!I thought it was a fluke but I tried another order and again only 1 bag!This drives me crazy because I love this product and it's one of the best bitlong beef jerky out there.  Please fix this and I will order more!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Decent, but nothing to write home about. However, this may be personal preference as I like beef jerky better.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I like to think of myself as a connoisseur of all things beef and I have to say this is one of the best products I have had in a long time.  The flavor/seasoning is amazing and it always seems fresh.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  very tasty\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  so happy to have a new flavor of brooklyn biltong!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Biltong is a form of dried, cured meat that originated in Southern African countries (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana and Zambia). Various types of meat are used to produce it, ranging from beef and game meats to fillets of meat cut into strips following the grain of the muscle, or flat pieces sliced across the grain. It is related to beef jerky in that they are both spiced, dried meats; however, the typical ingredients, taste and production processes may differ.I recently started a high protein low carb diet and needed something to snack on that's also healthy.  I love beef jerky and was also curious to try biltong, so I ordered this.  I love that this is a family founded/run company.  As the product description explains, this company started with the owner's Grandpa who was a South African butcher known for making incredible, delicious biltong.  His grandson now, via Brooklyn Biltong is introducing this beefy, delicious treat to America, using the family recipe and methods.  Unlike most processed jerky, it's made with grass-fed beef, and it's always sugar free, nitrate free, and gluten free.  It's really nutritious with 15g of protein per serving, 2g of fat, and 0g carbs (my favorite part).  There's also no added sugar.  The flavor is wonderful.  I can't handle anything spicy and this has a tiny trace of spice to it but definitely tolerable.  This biltong is marinated in vinegar and spices before being air dried, a process that gives it an incredible steaky flavor, and tender, chewy bite.  I think the amount of chew in each piece is perfect.  Not too soft, and not like leather that makes your teeth hurt.Like the description provides, it's a great idea to use this in other things too.  You can top pizza or a salad with it.  I took the suggestion to chop it up finely and include with my morning eggs.  It was really good.  The possibilities are endless really.  But I honestly love this as a snack.  I love that it's keto compliant!Overall, I highly recommend this.  It's a bit pricey but all jerky is and this is clearly better quality.  I like this and will be ordering more.  I think you'll like it, too.  Enjoy!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I had never heard of air drying meat rather than low-temperature cooking, and I was a little surprised when I received it to find that it has a little bit more of a pinkish color rather than brown. However, upon tasting it, and experiencing the incredible tenderness and rich flavor, I was a new convert.This meat has the consistency of a delightful roast that has been cooked until it's falling apart just a little bit, but retains some of the fun chewy texture you get from beef jerky, while also being much more tender.I really love the lemon pepper seasoning on this, it is just flavored enough to be extra delicious, without overwhelming the natural flavor of the meat.I just started a ketogenic diet about a week ago, and this stuff has been a godsend for a quick, ketogenic snack that tastes delicious and makes me feel like I'm having a wonderful treat.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I am a fan of jerky and like to try all its different offerings. Even though I have devices I could be dehydrating my own. I don't want to go that route . I love the ready made stuff ready to grab and snack on to keep me away from the carbs this way. This one had a amazing flavor I was skeptical at first lemon pepper with beef? I thought that be kind of a odd flavor combo but no it actually worked. I love this brand and would buy some again someday. I love that it has a nice chew and you get nice sheets of it as opposed to all broken up and too sweet and sticky like some other more well known brand is like. I think it has a good bite and flavor. its nice and chewy so you can take you're time chewing it and savoring it. I love this thank you. makes for a very tasty high protein snack.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I've tried a few kinds of biltong birth purchase from a store and ordered here on Amazon. I like the fact that it's made with less preservatives and sugar as sugar is not an option for me. I think I'm having issues with the texture. I know it's supposed to be more moist but it feels dry and crumbly in my mouth. The flavor is probably the best biltong that I have tasted. The lemon pepper with a little onion is really delicious but I can't get over this texture. Most of the biltong that I've tried is like this. It's a sliced a little thinner but it's like it has a hard time staying together. My spouse loves this and the texture as well. I also think they would eat any dried meat of any sort but particularly this brand has been a winner. Needless to say, mixed reviews in this house. I'm giving it four stars to bridge the difference between our opinions.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  The packaging makes it clear the company doesn't want this referred to as beef jerky, so I'll do my best! :) Anyway, this biltong is really good. While mostly tender compared to some beef jerky (oops!), some of the pieces definitely give me a bit of a jaw workout in order to chew them.The level of spice seems pretty perfect. I'm someone who doesn't mind super spicy stuff (so it could contain more and not bother me), but I'd say that even people who DON'T like super spicy would still probably like the level of spice in this meat.The packages are pretty small, but since they're preservative-free, it makes sense to keep them in portions that can be eaten within a short amount of time.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  It was excellent, my kids blew through the bag lol. Not too hard to chew either and all natural which is so important\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  good flavor, too thin, no fat\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I bought these as a gift for my husband, who loves jerky. I'm not a huge fan of jerky, but I love these. They have a ton of flavor and each one tastes exactly as the flavor advertises. My only complaint is they are too expensive to buy more often.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Well, I have to say, I just found my new favorite beef jerky. I am super picky when it comes to beef jerky and this product hit all of the things I love about great beef jerky. I could definitely taste the quality of the meat and seasoning ingredients. Every flavor I tried was just as good as the last one. I really don’t like hard, tough beef jerky and this product was easy to bite and chew without feeling like my jaw was going to dislocate. If you are a jerky eater, this is definitely one you should try.D. Dawley\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Fresh, bold and flavorful...3 words to describe these wonderful tasty jerky snacks. The flavors were exciting and unique compared  to other jerky brands. They give your tastebuds a boost of euphoria. The soft tender pieces were a delight to chew in stark contrast to hard dry jerky that are difficult to chew. The 1oz  snack packs are perfect for an afternoon snack, road trips or hikes with the family. No added hormones and Nitrites/Nitrates provides a healthy alternative to other dry meat snacks. Thank you Baja Jerky for creating out of the box jerky flavors! Will definitely buy again!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Ohio State volleyball D1!!!! Sean loves this grab and go perfect snack.

I bought the variety pack and so far my favorite is the sweet orange. The whole family loves Baja Jerky! Will order again for sure.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This stuff is so good! It is also sold at Sheetz gas stations!  Unfortunately there is still a soy product in the ingredients. The black pepper flavor is the only one I had tried. It has a nice spice kick to it. By far the only jerky I will buy from now on. All others take note, sugar is bad and it doesn't need to be on dried beef.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Very delicious, you think you're eating the regular , non zero sugar product but its in fact tasty, and 2 WW points for the whole bag so you don't feel guilty eating it all in one sitting. The pepper is not too strong but gives a good kick nonetheless when you bite into it. I'd suggest eating this over the movie theater popcorn anyday when watching a movie but that's just me.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Loved that this jerky has zero sugar but they use soy sauce to season it so i don't know why they just didn't make it teriyaki flavor and after you chew it it gets mushy..its already a soft jerky..so its not bad but I like a much harder smoked jerky like from bucees ( im from texas) so I think I'll stick to making my own\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Not disgusting, but not great. Average. A bit too salty for me but I’m also picky about salt. There is a subtle heat/pepperiness on the back end that was perfect to me. It is slightly bitter, though (perhaps from the soy sauce?) which I also didn’t care for. The bitterness dissipates quickly though.  I appreciate that the texture is slightly drier than Jack Links which I find entirely too soft. But I I also prefer extremely dry jerky but that’s often hard to find.  If you’re on keto and craving a sugar free jerky this isn’t a bad option at all. I probably won’t purchase again though.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Overall, I wouldn't be mad buying this from a gas station, but it's nothing to get excited about. The lack of sugar is great, but it's not substituted by any other flavors. The cuts of meat aren't terribly great. There isn't as much fat 'n such as others, but it's still only marginally better.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I have tried them all. This is it. If you aren\\'t down with the black pepper, the Original is also great.Meanwhile, I find it ironic that \"zero sugar\" beef jerky is something that requires specific marketing these days. Sugar doesn\\'t belong in beef jerky in the first place.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Tastes different then the beef jerky I'm used to, however you can tell that this is how beef jerky it's supposed to taste. It's surprising how much of the flavor you're used to is actually just the sugar, that said it's got kind of an intense flavor; took me a little while to finish the bag, would buy again.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I wanted to love these. but its SO HARD TO CHEW.... they are insane ruff. Love for my keto diet. wish they made them in tenderized.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  When I saw 0 sugar, had to give them a try. I like them, and purchase a bag about once a month, but usually from local store now instead of Amazon.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I purchased both these and the original flavor. These were pretty good but the original was better. Good texture and quality.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  The jerky has the perfect amount of lemon! It is delicious!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Good stuff. Bit expensive\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  There's a sweetness about it that I'm not a fan of. I was hoping this would bring back childhood but it didn't. I definitely  like ayoba-yo way better.

Buyers beware of this brand and trust me on this one.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I've eaten jerky for decades now, from small mom/pop setups in TX, to larger name brands (yuck). Luckily the internet (and rating systems) have allowed me to avoid the bad jerkys. Everyone has differing tastes, so my review is partial to what I like, which is:1) dry, but not impossible to chew. The meat comes apart enough where a bit of saliva and chewing make it easy to eat. Some dry/dense jerky's require many minutes of hydration and chew to consume.2) does not seem to have any gristle/fat chunks that some other brands i've tried have.3) does not use soy sauce (therefore gluten free).4) minimal processing and not too many ingredients (KISS principle).5) No overpowering sauces/spices so the meat/smoke flavor actually comes forth well.6) not too smoky, nor sweet, not too spicy either.I bought 3 pounds for my employees and it was gone in almost a week. I like this one the best (flavorwise). I do wish it was a bit spicier, but I do like things pretty spicy (which could obscure/hide the meat flavor)\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I bought this beef jerky many times and the flavor/ spices are very good. The quality of meat on the other hand is inconsistent. Sometimes it is perfect but mostly it is either very fatty, crumbly ( I personally do not mind that), or like the last bag I received, too tough and impossible to chew. I think it might be the cut of the meat that contains too much tendons, or whatever. So, it is hit and miss, one time it is excellent, the other time it is horrible.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  8/29/2020 update: purchased 2 packages of the Limon Con Chile. One of them a gift. Unfortunately they changed the recipe and it tastes completely different. I would compare the taste to a can of hormel chili. Disappointed I spent $60 on gross jerky and embarrassed that I went on and on about how good this jerky was to the person I sent it to.I purchased the  Limón Con Chile jerky. It’s soooo good! I checked the ingredients of all jerkys in my grocery store and other retail stores and they all had sugar. Even my local butchers wouldn’t make jerky without sugar. After much research I found this company and I’m so happy I did!I know taste is very subjective but I think the  Limón Con Chile jerky has the perfect kick with still being able to taste the meat.I love thin jerkys with a dry texture and this fits my texture preference perfectly!The one pound bag comes with a lot of jerky. Well worth the price.The only thing I wish for is more of a lemon/lime flavor to it but it’s fantastic as is.  Will be purchasing this again!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I've bought many packages of this Limón Con Chile flavor and The Original. I'd say though that they have about a 20% letdown rate. If you unlucky enough to get one of these packages, the beef will be rock hard, stringy, and jaw achingly painful if you dare to dry and consume. So know it'll be a gamble until they look into their quality control. That said, if you get one of their good quality packages, its extremely yummy and worth every penny.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I was really excited to get a big bag of jerky for decent price. The problem is it's dry and tough. One of my molars is soar and I am worried that it is loose now. I couldn't get through two pieces one day. I thought I would try a bit the next day but I couldn't get past chewing one bite. Now I am stuck with a bag of jerky that cost $26 and nobody can eat it.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Carne Seca is my fourth bag of People\\'s Choice Jerky. It is not the cheapest jerky, because it is quality jerky with ingredients that I trust. This is why I\\'ll keep buying it.  I\\'ve had the spicy traditional (or old fashioned), and then teriyaki and spicy big slabs. Carne Seca is my favorite, but each type is so different that I\\'ll probably get something else next time to continue exploring their line-up.My experiences:Traditional (old fashioned): this is old school, meat and salt baby. It\\'s delicious, but tough and will give your mouth a work out. I loved it.Spicy big slab: Way too much red and black pepper, it\\'s too much. But, If you scrape some of the pepper off it\\'s delicious. I actually liked it because the spice limited how fast I ate the stuff. But People\\'s Choice, if you\\'re reading...please dial it back like 30%.Teriyaki Big slab: This was like candy. So sweet and yummy, its not the easiest stuff to chew but my wife still housed it. This is her favorite hands down.Carne Seca: The flavor is \"mexicany\", and it is very good. It almost reminds me of the old jerky that came in a snuff can. The texture is also completely different from any of the others that I\\'ve tried. Very easy to chew...My two year old can actually chomp on this.I have become a loyal customer and I highly recommend this jerky.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Very good, I liked this one better than the plain jerky of the same brand.I read in some of the negative comments about it being powdery or tasting old which worried me since I ordered 2 lbs of it in total.  The texture was perfect.  It was very dry, as jerky should be (I hate the moist stuff you find in t he stores) and it tears apart just like the stuff I make at home.  It did have some fat on it, but just the right amount to add more flavor.  There was a surprising amount in the bag, so paying so much for it was easier to swallow, but took longer to swallow than I had planned since there was so much of it!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I really enjoyed the People's Choice Big Slab/Whole muscle jerky, absolutely fantastic stuff, but this Carne Seca Limón Con Chile Jerky however, fell a little short of my expectations. The beef itself is decent, definitely softer, more moist and not nearly as tough and chewy as the whole muscle slab, but still a little tougher than the big time offerings from Jack Links and like. That is definitely a pro for some people and a con for others. The lack of sugar is noticeable, but as it is supposed to be Keto friendly, you should already be expecting that going in and I can't knock it for that. Having recently started Keto myself, it is nice to have a truly sugar-free jerky option available, there are few out there. Honestly, my only real complaint was with the chilies. I barely felt any heat at all while eating it but REALLY felt it on the back end of things (if you know what I mean!) as if I had eaten something 10X more spicy. Strange. I probably won't buy this one again and will explore their other flavors instead, but still recommend at least giving it a try.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  First off, these guys make excellent beef jerky and I have never had a product I disliked.  I liked the Nashville and Hot & Spicy ones.  Then I met the Orange Honey Teriyaki which is a killer flavor!  But then my mind was blown when I tried Carne Seca - Limon con Chile.  Let me start by saying I absolutely hate the taste of lemon (except for lemonade).  So I was immediately turned off by the description but tried a piece from a friend's bag.  I don't taste the lemon which is good for me!  Then I read the ingredients and learned it had guajillo chiles, that's a new taste for me I was recently introduced to (thank you Subway for briefly having guajillo sauce).  Hands down this is my favorite beef jerky flavor with the Orange Honey Teriyaki as a close second.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Wow is the word for this incredible product. I have been trying different kinds and different brands of jerky, but People's Choice hit the nail right on the head. those others who claim to make the best jerky, are so far off. This beef jerky has the perfect texture and isn't too tough or too soft, It's perfect and does not have any nerve endings or tendons or any tough to chew pieces. All are consistently the same.  I ordered 3 packages in my first order, and have already ordered another 4 packages, because I don't want to run out. I offer to friends, family and co workers, whom all agree that its the best. Thank you at People's Choice Beef Jerky for producing an out of the ordinary high quality product. You have my business and I will definitely recommend your product always. Two big thumbs up.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  So, let me start by saying I\\'m a bit of jerky connoisseur. Maybe even a little bit of a jerky snob lol. As such, I don\\'t care for things like Jack Links. Although they have awesome commercials, it is, in my opinion, not \"real\" beef jerky. Now, I don\\'t know how the rest of the world defines \"real\" beef jerky, but this is the easiest way I differentiate the real from the not so real- if your jerky says \"refrigerate after opening\" or \"use within 7 days of opening,\" I\\'m sorry but that\\'s not real jerky. The whole point of jerky, in my mind anyway, is that it takes a long time to go bad- it is real, dried, meat.Now that I have that out of the way, let me say that if you like \"real\" beef jerky, this stuff is awesome. If you prefer the more moist \"jerkies\" like Jack Links, Ball Park, etc., you will probably still like it. It is lean, so not real greasy, and the flavor is awesome. It is a little moist (not dry and super flat like Love\\'s brand jerky- which is still one of my favorites), but not too moist. I\\'ve had most of their flavors, and though I don\\'t care for the \"Original\", the \"Old Fashioned\" and \"Carne Seca\" lines are amazing. The \"Tasting Kitchen\" flavors, while not my favorite, are interesting as well.Now, to address the whole \"refrigerate after opening\" thing, People\\'s Choice actually says on their website that they recommend against refrigerating their product, which is really refreshing. It does have an expiration date of one year after packaging, but I promise it won\\'t last that long :).Also, if you are one of those people (like I once was) that believes that jerky should come from a beef state like Texas or Oklahoma, do not fear. This stuff comes from downtown Los Angeles, but it is freaking amazing.I will probably never be able to label a beef jerky my favorite, but this one is definitely in my current top three (Love\\'s(Robertson\\'s), Buc-ee\\'s Peppered, & People\\'s Choice).So, to sum all of my rambling up, you should try this jerky. If you\\'re not sure, try a smaller bag- I promise that the next time you\\'ll be buying more. And, I did not receive any sort of discount or freebee from People\\'s Choice for this review. Although, People\\'s Choice, if you\\'re listening, I wouldn\\'t turn down a discount! Lol\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Wanting traditional Dry Jerky, not the wet type permeating every type nowadays. Had just tried Hard Times Beef Jerky which was what I was looking for. While waiting for a re-order of that brand decided to also get People\\'s Choice Beef Jerky. Arrived today in a SEALED Ziplock 1lb bag. First slice looked dry and tasted almost like traditional Been Jerky. Was just a tad moist. The Kicker was when I went for my second strip. Surprise ! Refer to 1st image. It was white, round, fuzzy and the size of about a dime on the 2nd strip. As I then as I looked into the bag, noticed more strips with white & fuzzy discoloration. I poured the strips in the bag onto a clean tray. Found numerous strips that had white fuzz (mold/mildew) as small as a spot to strips that were almost covered in this \"extra ingredient\". Refer to other images. So, since the bag was sealed, either the dehydrating environment was not clean, and/or the meat was not dried/processed properly. 1st time trying People\\'s Choice due to all the \"Rave\" reviews. Not sure if I may give it another chance. Contacted seller. Awaiting reply.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Update: I have now ordered (and eaten) 4 pounds of this jerky. Far and above the best jerky on the market. Great taste, texture and incredibly consistent. Some may not like the occasional little bit of fat on the strips. I rather enjoy it, and consider it a part of well made natural strip jerk. Highly recommend.Original: I like to take jerky on road trips and camping, but have been really disappointed with what's available in stores. Almost all jerky these days is like Jack Link's and Krave; weird translucent gelatinous meat products. People's Choice beef jerky is exactly what I was looking for. Solid strips of dried, well-seasoned meat.  The kind you need to to use your teeth to rip a piece off, but is not too dry and brittle. I have a hard time not eating it all in the first couple of days.  Since the package isn't resealable, it's good to have on hand a gallon ziplock bag to throw them in once opened.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I have purchased this multiple times as a Keto snack to stay on my low carb high fat diet and I’ve always enjoyed it and never received a bad batch until now!!! I kept the bag at my office and have been snacking on it little by little over the last week and today I reached all the way in and discovered most of it covered in green mold!!!!!🤢🤮. I think I’m going to be sick... and I’ve been eating a lot of it today and wasn’t looking at what I was grabbing while on phone calls so I literally probably will get very sick! So gross!!!!!!!!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Best Beef Jerkey Ever.  It has been really hard to find a beef jerkey that has the old fashioned texture of Real Beef Jerkey along with a wonderful taste without all the sugar that Beef Jerkey's now have.  It crazy how companies put sugar into everything.  I have been around for almost 60 years, and I watched simple good tasting products like beef jerky and even Blue Cheese Dressing and Ranch Dressing, which never had any sugar in it before now in are age is just filled with Sugar, Brown Sugar, Corn Syrup, and even Honey.  Why!!!.  I think Sugar has become an addiction for most of us.  Anyway, I am really glad that People's Choice has kept the simple orginal recipe for Beef Jerky without Sugar and I just love this Beef Jerky and will continue to buy it for my husband.  Because of Autoimmune issues my Doctor has switched me over to just Grass-Fed Meats, because regular processed cows eat corn and soy that have a higher count of Lectins in the meat which cause inflammation.  So, I will no longer be able to eat this wonderful beef jerky because it is not Grass-fed.  It is normal feed corn and soy fed Cow meat, which has a higher count of Inflammatory Lectins.  For normal healthy people that's not a problem, Like my husband.  So, I will continue to buy for him this beef Jerky.  He loves it too.  But for myself, I need to look for something else.  So, that's why I have to give it only 4 Stars, only because it is not Grass-Fed Beef.  If you don't have to eat grass-fed meats than it's 5 star.  Anyway, Love this Beef Jerky, I hope soon that they will also have a grass-fed, Beef Jerky that is as good and simple in ingredients as this Original Old Fashioned  Beef Jerky.  Thank you that you left out the Sugar and Soy Sauce or Worcestershire Sauce that has Gluten in it .  It realy soo cool to have found a Sugar Free/Gluten Free Beef Jerky, now it just needs to be Grass-Fed.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The 1st time I purchased this jerky on here, I was in heaven. It was my fav jerky and awesome for a keto low carb lifestyle. I  then bought it from their main site to see if there was any difference and it was good, but not as awesome as the first time on here. Then I purchased it through here again, and it was like a totally different jerky than the other times. Really thin and fatty/greasy/slimy pieces that still tasted hard and almost stale. For the price it was a huge disappointment especially since it is costly so I bought it as a treat for me at Christmas time again.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This jerky is AMAZING.  Important note is that it\\'s not the type of jerky you usually find in the grocery store these days (moist and full of artificial stuff).  It is truly the old-fashioned type of jerky I remember from my childhood, it\\'s drier and chewier (so yummy!) and it\\'s full of natural beef flavor.  The flavor is delicious, it\\'s not covered up with a bunch complicated ingredients and processing - just very natural full-flavored beef.  I\\'ve tried a lot of jerky, and this one is just so good.  Don\\'t buy it if you like the current style of ultra-moist \"flavor profiled\" type of jerky, but if you like all natural, NO preservatives, NO sugar, natural beefy flavor and old-fashioned drier style of jerky - it\\'s just perfect.  I\\'ve already ordered more on a recurring subscription, it\\'s that good.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This jerky is reminiscent of the sort I used to carry years ago on long hikes. I experienced no carb highs and crashes, just sustained energy accompanied by a longer period of feeling full. I\\'ve now removed all sugar and grain from my diet for required and personal reasons. That\\'s been a good move for me, but it\\'s not a lifestyle change that offers a breadth of relatively appealing snack options that don\\'t require 45 minutes to prepare. This version of People\\'s Choice Beef Jerky I can snack on straight out of the bag. I think it\\'s grand, and clearly many others who\\'ve written reviews here do, too. But there are also several categories of negatives I\\'d like to address, because some of the negatives are actually positives, some can be avoided by reading the product description, some can be explained through general knowledge of what ingredients are.* \"It\\'s dry.\" I\\'ve always thought beef jerky was supposed to be mostly dry, but not completely dry. It\\'s nice to have just enough moisture to keep chewing on a piece (as you would gum) to reap the flavor rewards. That\\'s one of jerky\\'s neat benefits. But if you\\'re upset it\\'s \"dry,\" check out the product description. I see no misrepresentation of general moisture content there.* \"It\\'s not tough enough\" or \"It pulls apart too easily.\" The jerky in my bag wasn\\'t easy to pull or even bend apart against the grain. With the grain, pulling was easier, but I\\'d expect that. My teeth played tug often enough, and I must have terribly weak hands, because I couldn\\'t make one full strip of jerky rip with and against the grain into a stack of pieces. I could, however, cut it into a stack of pieces with a knife. If really, really tough, hard-to-separate jerky is what you\\'re looking for, then this version might not be for you.* \"It\\'s too greasy\" or \"It\\'s fatty.\" I wasn\\'t constantly wiping my fingers on a towel to remove a greasy coating. In fact, I didn\\'t have to do that once. I found it pretty difficult to visually distinguish much fat in the product. That said, fat is what helps impart flavor to meat, and all fats tend to feel greasy. Nicely marbled beef is far preferable to cuts with little fat. You\\'d hope there was something of fat left in a dried meat product if you want some flavor. The product label pictured above says there are 2.5 grams total fat in each serving. A serving of classic Lay\\'s Potato Chips contains 10 grams total fat.  \"Greasy\" is a subjective sensation, but still, it\\'s no trouble to check how much objective fat is in a product.* \"There\\'s no pepper in this \\'peppered\\' jerky.\" Well, there\\'s no ground black peppercorn in this peppered version. However, there is paprika, and a nice dose of it. Paprika is a fine powder made from plants in the pepper family. Think bell pepper, red pepper. Different paprikas produce different tastes. This jerky has a spicy quality. In the plant world, there are peppers, and there are peppers, and then there are more peppers. The ingredients list usually tells you which basic sort of pepper you\\'ll find in the product.My personal \"complaints\"? This product is worth all the pennies. My pocket book just wishes it cost fewer pennies, because I plan to keep ordering. Oh, and there was some spice residue left on my plate after munching. Why couldn\\'t all that tastiness stay on the strip?  ;)\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  First I want to start off by saying I never ever review products on Amazon. The quality of this jerky and the fact that it comes from a family owned business is why I am taking the time for this review. I\\'m going on a road trip soon and was looking for the perfect jerky to take along. I have never been a fan of \"gas station jerky\" the name brands that you can find anywhere that have an odd chewy wet texture and taste like anything under the sun besides beef. If \"gas station jerky\" is the only kind you have ever had then please... for your sake try THIS (people\\'s choice beef jerky) jerky! Other reviews comment on the dryness of this jerky and I just want to add that is just in comparison to what you would find at the store. I was concerned it was going to be too dry, be very tough, and get stuck in my teeth. Because of the ingredients and all of the amazing reviews I decided to give it a shot. Obviously I was pleasantly surprised. It arrived 20 minutes ago and I\\'ve already had three pieces 😅 (might need to order another bag for my trip) and I\\'m not searching for a toothpick or desperate for a glass of water! And the taste 😱 simplicity is perfection in this case! It taste like BEEF jerky lol sounds silly to write but once you try it you\\'ll understand. Well worth the money. Well worth my time to write this. I will be purchasing more in the future!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Wow!  I have been trying various kinds beef jerky for forty years looking for the right one.  I have had good bef jerky a few times before but it was always some unbranded stuff sold by the stick at a mom and pop store.  I presume made by someone in the community.  All the branded \"legal\" jerky was at best, just ok.  This is different.  This jerky is good stuff!!I\\'ve had remarkable success by being guided by Amazon\\'s reviews so i started looking at beef jerky on Amazon.  I saw the reviews this jerky received and wanted to try it.  I was a little concerned about paying $30 for a bag of jerky but I\\'ve paid hundreds over the years for bad jerky so I decided to give it a try.THIS IS WHAT BEEF JERKY IS SUPPOSED TO BE!!!  Natural, not \"formed.\"  Salty yet chewable.  If there was a hall of fame for beef jerky (and there ought to be) Peoples Choice would be in it.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  They are very fresh & spicy 🌶 and taste more like a raw jalapeño pork summer sausage than the game, cold beef hot dog. I’ve been cycling in and out of Keto every 90days for 3 years now. (Jan, Feb & March ON - April, May and June OFF - July, August and Sept ON - October, November and December OFF) I’ve tried SO MANY different brands of beef sticks, I discovered these in March and have been hooked ever since! I’m still eating these while not in Ketosis - I HIGHLY recommend these! Give them a try and you’ll see what I mean!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I tried these jerky sticks because they were cheaper than Chomps (the ones I usually get). The first thing I noticed after biting into one was how much they taste like the gas station jerky sticks. I did more research and found out that Lorissa\\'s Kitchen is actually owned by Jack Link’s parent company, (the company that makes Slim Jims). I can\\'t speak on how \"healthy\" these really are or anything like that but if you\\'re not a big fan of the regular, super chewy and greasy type jerky sticks I\\'d recommend finding something else. I\\'ll be finishing the pack I got because I already paid for them but I\\'ll probably go back to Chomps or Vermont Smoke and Cure after this.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I bought these as just a nice easy snack you can eat between meals.TASTE: I bought the Jalapeno flavor since I like a bit of heat and these did fail to provide that. Probably a perfect amount. Possibly too much for a child but a good amount for an adult who likes a bit of heat. The actual beefstick is not necessarily tremendous but definitely better than a slim jim and probably made better as well. Overall, the taste was excellent...suited me just fine.PRICE: Here's where I basically had to take away a star because honestly when you are thinking about buying price is a factor. You are essentially paying $2 for a beefstick you will eat in almost 60 seconds, haha. Although very tasty and may be a bit healthy, the price stay is a bit too steep for my liking.BUY AGAIN: Sure, I would buy these again BUT only when I have a little extra money to spend on something tasty.  They are good and worth trying and if you have the money, they are definitely a nice spicy treat.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I've ordered a few different brands of beef sticks from Amazon and some have tasted like plastic and some of them just didn't taste good, period.  This is a solid beef stick with great flavor.  Comparable to a Slim Jim, but possibly made with better ingredients.  These are a bit oily/greasy, but they taste great; I just wish they were a little cheaper, especially to those that eat them as much as I do.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I’m doing keto, and these are very good. I’d like to think they are a much healthier alternative to all the nitrites. But anyway, I think these taste better than anything I can find in a local store ever since they stopped carrying Chomps. All I can find are Jack Links and Slim Jims, and these taste better. The stick size is very filling as well. A satisfied customer. And in case anyone is wondering: they arrived quickly, well packager, none are bad or moldy and the couple I have eaten so far taste very fresh, I will reorder for sure.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  These are a standard length beef stick with great flavor and a spicy kick. They have a traditional texture, not mushy like some others I've tried. The packages are easy open, and the box they come in can be opened by tearing off the top at the perferation or opening it like a regular box top. I prefer these over the smokey sweet flavor of the same brand because they pack more of a flavor punch. They're nothing earth shattering but they're beef sticks and they are my new favorites right now. They are a great value for grass-fed. I would highly recommend these and will be ordering again.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Love these! I tried the the original and jalapeño 12pack no complaints but I bought the original for $20 and now it’s $24? In less than a week the price for the same thing just went up $4. Then a month later it’s up to $33. Y’all need to stick with one price. I’m paying $33 for some glorified healthy slim Jim.  There are other brands that are cheaper\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  A great snack on the go when you don\\'t have time for lunch! They fill you up (don\\'t eat more than one, though- that made me feel a bit sick!).... they are spicy and tasty and my fav beef jerky stick and I\"ve tried many!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I love these meat sticks.  They are some of the best tasting I've ever tried, and cheaper than most too (they also often go on sale or have coupons available).  I prefer the original flavor, but the jalapeno are pretty good too.  Very rich, not too dry, and best of all, no sugar.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Found these in a local convenience store and was so happy to find them on Amazon. They are pricey but worth it. I am a repeat buyer.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Incredible biltong and the fact that it’s kosher is amazing. Delicious flavor and texture. The original flavor stands out which was surprising to me because I’m a huge fan of all of the flavors. Highly recommend!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Hide them. The packs are small and delicious. If you are the unfortunate recipient of living with Le Wild Teenagers and a grown man who acts like said teenager, HIDE THE JERKY. Leave a pack out as a prize for good habits or a day you don’t smell man axx lurking in a room.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  It's a shame.  Jack Link's is a good product, but 3 packs, specifically the Teriyaki, had MOLD.  Believe the reviewers that talk about the mold.  I ate a piece and quickly spit it out.  Opening others, I smelled first and could smell the MOLD.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  So disgusted. Ordered this thinking it will be great snack for work.all I got was mold.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I'm a fan of this brand, as the flavor is good, the product fresh, and this pack is SUPER because of the packaged portions. I like how this jerky comes in bite sized pieces, so I'm not having to bite apart huge hunks of meat. This flavor is also quite peppery, and I like the flavor. I love the packages because they're just enough, and I don't overeat. They're also portable, and perfect for purse, lunch, or your desk at work.The jerky is peppery and delicious without fat; at least I taste no fat and don't see it. Bravo! This is a bit of a snack investment price-wise, but it's worth the money, and I'd buy it again. Great product & highly recommended!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  There isn't much in each package and though they are trying to keep it at 100 cal., the price is expense for what you get. You are probably paying for they packaging for each snack package and to me it isn't worth the cost.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I purchased this as stocking stuffers for my family for Christmas. The package arrived today with Jack's Links written all over the box. Now I can't use it for gifts.The portion for the price is totally overpriced. I was willing to pay this so that my family would not see me purchase it at the store and then I could use it for gifts. Plan ruined.Paid too muchWasn't worth itVery disappointed\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Needed some extra snacks to carry in bags that can last a somewhat good length of time. These fit the bill and are really, really good. Not chewing on shoe leather here. Some are very soft and the taste is not overwhelming. Still it's jerky. Bring water. LOL Very happy with these. Would have liked to see a resealable bag though. Small but I'd to spread out the eating time.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I enjoy these as a snack throughout the day since I generally only eat one big meal instead of your typical 3-4I like how all 3 favors taste pretty good; it isnt like other brands where you dread to finish that last flavor you've been holding off.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  the meat tastes absolutely rotten. Its inedible like im not being dramatic when i say i can not eat it. id honestly like a refund :(\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Jerky is tasty enough, but it's all little pieces and crumbs as if they filled the bags with scraps.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  First, I must say that Jack Link\\'s is my go-to jerky brand. I sometimes branch out and dabble in some fancy brands with fancy flavors, but I never stop buying Jack Link\\'s. I\\'m unable to replace the value of the flavor, texture, and price point with any other brand.Now, to Zero Sugar. For me, fails on all three counts.Flavor – seemingly way too salty to compensate for lack of sugar. Even if it doesn\\'t have that much more salt, it tastes like it does. The peppery taste that others complain about – well, I like pepper. Jack Link\\'s Peppered is one of my two must-haves (the other being Sweet n\\' Hot).  This, however, is a weird pepperiness that doesn\\'t excite me. It\\'s not so much a flavor you taste while actively first sinking your teeth into it, but rather a weird bite that comes out as you relentlessly try to gnaw it... Which leads me to...Texture – only flavor of this brand that is dry, stringy, and super-tough. Some pieces have been so tough, I had to throw them away. I literally couldn\\'t even get the chewing started. Sugar must be a required ingredient to maintain chewability, tenderness, and anti-stringy texture.  Last point...Price – not only is the value not there for reasons mentioned above (inedibility, to sum up), but because it was more expensive per ounce, it\\'s more loss than just, \"I don\\'t care for this flavor\"... It\\'s, \"I paid WHAT for THAT?\"Perhaps this has fans out there... Fans with VERY strong teeth who do not require the same level of moisture in foods as I do.... and like lots of salt and weird peppery zing (or are so dedicated to no sugar they are willing to tolerate it).I am not one of those people.Bring on the sugar...\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  It's unbelievable that Jack Links would send out a product so friggin NASTY!! This stuff was grey and about to turn green. Is there no QA at Jack Links? Gave them 1 star cause I couldn't zero stars. To be fair, only 1 bag was moldy but I can't take a chance and eat the other bag.....Sasquatch would not be happy!!!Update.....Decided to open the other bag and taste the jerky. Taste absolutely nasty! Too salty and tough.....yuk. The best buy date on both bags was June 2020.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I ordered this jerky and only received one pack, not two. Unfortunately for me, my dog decided to rip open that pack before I could try it myself and went to town on it. So I went back and purchased the same item and this time I actually did receive two packs and I also got to enjoy it! The jerky has a wonderful flavor and wasn’t overly tough like some jerky’s can be. I only gave it three stars because the first time around I only received one pack, rather than two. When that’s the case, the value for your money is not there. I was grateful that the second time I ordered it I received both packs. I’m not sure if that is a mistake that happens often or if it was just a fluke, but it would make me hesitant to reorder again in the future even though the jerky was so tasty.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I\\'ve been a fan of the original flavor of Link\\'s beef jerky for ages (although these days I like Old Trapper even better), so when a new-to-me \"Zero Sugar\" showed up as a recommendation on Amazon I figured i had to try it.  Healthier, right?Unfortunately, this flavor is NOT up to their regular standards.  The jerky is /really/ dry, with a very different (kind of pasty) texture, and instead of a nice beefy flavor it is very heavily spiced -- not quite to the strength of the peppered, but also without being clearly a single note like the peppered.It\\'s not *bad* or anything, and if you\\'re diabetic or serious about keto, this would probably be worth.  But if you\\'re just trying to be a little healthier by avoiding added sugars when/if convenient, the sacrifice in taste/texture is not worth it, stick to the Original.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Arrived quickly, but both packages had grey mold growing in them. In all my years of eating jerky, I have never seen a moldy pack of beef jerky. If it\\'s made and stored correctly, it lasts quite a long time and shouldn\\'t get moldy. The expiration date was June 2020 and this order was in Oct 2019, so it still had quite a bit of \"shelf life\" left. Amazon processed the return quickly and obviously I didn\\'t need to bother shipping it back so it\\'s not a huge \"loss\" for me, but still annoying when you are expecting some nice jerky and now you have to run to the store instead. Based on other recent reviews, it looks like I\\'ll have to stick to buying it in the local shops instead.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Received and one of the bags was moldy. All of the jerky.  There is not a expiration date on the packages which has me a bit concerned. I just received it 30 minutes ago and opened up to enjoy. Oh no. The smell was horrid.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  After receiving my second batch, I realize the first batch i received was not the freshest. It was very tough and it had an odd smell. It grew moldy very quickly. The most recent batch I received is much different, it’s tender and it even has a brighter color. So it may be hit or miss quality wise.Update (3/6/20) : I was hoping that the second batch was an indicator of better quality control, but the third shipment I received has proved otherwise. It’s barely edible. I’m surprised that there is such a drastic lack of consistency.  That and the ineligibility for a refund is costing a star.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I orderd this as an almost zero snack choice. I figured it would probably be pretty good since most of their products are, but boy was I wrong.It has an off-putting appearance straight away. It's covered in a faint white crust, very similar to an aged dog turd. The flavor isn't any better. It has almost no flavor whatsoever.I wouldn't recommend buying this. Definitely just get some jerky with a small amount of sugar, because god knows it needs it.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Great for people who cannot have jerky because they put in to much sugar per ounce.  This jerky is salty for my taste and I love salty things so hoping they will back off on the salt a tad.  My bags came with 1/2 of the bag in shreds which makes it harder to eat.  There are not many choices out there that do not have sugar in them so for now this product will do until I find something better quality or they increase their quality for the price they charge.I ordered again to possibly get a better quality product but sorry to say the jerky was so tough and lots of sinew throughout.  I will not order again.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Terrible odor emitting from this bag of zero sugar jack links jerky. It visually looks appealing but the product itself smells like rotten meat. After eating/tasting a few pieces, it has a similar flavor....This is both unacceptable, and concerning.I have purchased other zero sugar brands and have had experienced perfectly normal products. The thing with zero sugar is that the product may be drier, and a bit bland, but it will still have a distinctive 'jerky' taste.... this is not the case with my recent shipment.I will be contacting amazon, requesting a full refund. I would advise any purchasers to be wary with this product.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  After serving in the military, I lost many molars from military dental work. I have loved beef jerky all of my life but after my accident in the military, beef jerky (amongst many other edible items) I could no longer enjoy. I found these one day at Wal-Mart on a close out table...the rest is history. These are hands down the best and most flavorfull beef sticks EVER. I found myself once again being able to enjoy beef sticks. These are soft, easy on my jaw (living with mandibular osteonecrosis) and full of deep delicious, and a hint of spicy flavor. Thank you all who manufacturer these beef sticks and pray that you guys stay producing as long as humanly possible!! If I ever hit the lotto, I'm buying 1000000000 packs from you guys!! Until then, 4 at a time and more.Thank you again,Your biggest military veteran fan 😂😂\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  A friend recommended it to me, picked up the bag.  I got the original just to try it out.Taste:A light peppery flavorWoody smoke flavorGood tearing without being stupid hard or stringyLight texture to the outside, not oddly smooth like other jerkies.Kind of wish there was a smaller bag I could get, because I like to eat bit by bit and the large bag tempts me too much.This jerky would stack up to any I have had, and I recommend it to anyone who is wanting to try a good solid jerky without getting crazy.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Bought one pack last week,  since then I have bought 4 more.  This is the best  that I have ever had.  Ihave been purchasing different brands for years.  Over the last few years I have spent several 100 dollarson all kinds,  expensive,  gourmet,  organic,  the best they had to sell.  I wasn't concerned too much aboutthe price,  if it was good quality and had the taste that I was looking for.Well,  here comes the facts,  truth and a pure clean honest review.  This stuff is NOT greasy or in any waywet, oily or lard like.  It has the perfect texture and NOT soggy and in no way dry.  It is absolutely PERFECT.The flavor is just the right amount of ( heat ) spice.  It is not salted to where it's not edible.  This sausagereminds me of the pioneer dried meat that they might have eaten back in the day.  It's NOT like a Slim Jim that appearsto be made from chemistry 101.  It DOES NOT burn you from your throat all the way out.The price is very fair for the amount and quality,  you get about 12 to 14 stick per package.  The freshnessdate is very acceptable and it arrived professionally packaged and in pristine condition.  If you desire thistype of snacks,  camping or hiking staple,  then buy you several packages.  I honestly believe you will beenvery satisfied...5-22-19Just ordered 4 more bags,  ( stocking up ).  This makes 10 bags total for the past week.  It's good stuff,I wouldn't lie to you...\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This is going to be part of a Christmas present so I can’t attest to the taste but thought people should know the bag arrived half full. Jerky is expensive and I was disappointed with how little was included.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  It has good flavor although it was supposed to be teriyaki and I checked the bag to make sure I had teriyaki. I could not detect teriyaki.Thickly cut which is why it is tough. There is no artificial or natural tenderizers listed on the ingredient list which is a good thing. I hope my teeth grow back because it really is tough. One piece required me to reach in my mouth and remove it after five minutes of chewing with little progress.The second toughest jerky I have tried and I have eaten many different brands. In 2004 I bought some from the jerky store in the Plaza casino in Las Vegas. That was the toughest I have ever tried and my teeth loosened up then as they did from this brand. This is authentic. Calling it steak does not mean it comes from a place on the cow where it would be served at a steak house. The difference between a chuck steak or a chuck roast is whether it is over or under an inch thick.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Dear god this is great beef jerky.  It came almost bone dry, exactly the way I like it, and the flavor is amazing.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  So I open the bag, I eat a piece and it has the perfect texture. The flavor was okay, so I was at least mildly excited that I’d be able to eat some good tough beef jerky. I get three pieces in, reach into the bag and I feel something sticky and moist. Oh no, not the feel of a grocery store beef jerky... the rest of the bag had maybe two pieces of good jerky. So upset what a waste of money\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I love beef jerky. Some of my favorite beef jerky is Tillamook, World Kitchens, Old Trapper and Jack Links. This Jerkey just does not stand up to the other brands. I wanted to like it because it was inexpensive.  It is just too sweet. It was sticky and I thought I had made a mistake and ordered a candied jerkey or something. The texture of the beef was good and it was tender and easy for the most part to chew. If it were a little more on the savory side I think it would have given Jack Links a run for it money. Jack Links is on the bottom of my list of jerky I'll eat. The best jerky in my opinion is still World Kitchens. Old Trapper is my 2nd favorite. Next time I'll pay extra for a higher quality brand.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I wish I would have read the ingredient list before I bought this. In particular, Smoke Flavoring has an un-natural acrid aftertaste. And why do you need to add Sodium Nitrite!?  A quick Internet search shows that is not good for you.  That's not an opinion, there is science to back it.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  The smoke flavor was good but I didn't prefer the sweet factor. It arrived sealed and fine but did look really gooey in the bag. I thought it was natural fat/grease that warmed up during shipping so I put it in the fridge for a few hours but the gooey factor remained. On a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being ridiculously salty, this earned a 4.5If that score was more of a 2 or 3 I may have ordered again. After 1 piece you can practically see your body retaining water and swelling. Don't take this on a camping or hiking trip, you'll dehydrate fast. Will probably cause shoes and rings to become adhered to your body as well. Good luck with that.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Product arrived Moldy, although expiration wasn't for another 5 months.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This product is so unbelievably salty that it\\'s practically inedible.  Now, I am fully aware of the fact that most other beef jerky and beef stick type products are quite salty, but this is far beyond the usual salt/sodium level of any such products I\\'ve tried.This isn\\'t merely a subjective taste perception on my part, but let me back it up with objective facts, which should be alarming to any health-conscious individual: an 1-oz serving of this product contains 640 mg of sodium, which is a whopping 27% of the DV (Daily Value).  In other words, a mere 1 oz of this product, which is literally only a few bites, contains nearly 1/3 of the sodium that the FDA recommends that an average adult consumes the entire day.  In comparison with a similar product of the same size, the Original Beef Stick by Lorissa\\'s Kitchen, an 1-oz serving contains 330 mg of sodium, which is 14% of the Daily Value.  Mind you, the latter product is already quite salty, on the higher end of most people\\'s sodium threshold, and yet the sodium content in this Jack Link\\'s product is just shy of DOUBLE that of the Lorissa\\'s Kitchen product.  Incredible, and incredibly disappointing.This is very unfortunate because I had a positive impression of Jack Link\\'s before trying this product, and I had high hopes for it.  I had even added it to my \"Subscribe & Save\" orders here on Amazon... but I promptly cancelled this subscription after I tasted it and found out how ridiculously and dangerously salty it was.By the way, I\\'ve worked for the better part of 20 years as a R&D Food Scientist, and I am also a former Registered Dietitian, so I definitely know what I am talking about when it comes to taste, flavor, health, nutrient levels, etc.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I love the Jack Link's beef steaks that I buy at my corner store. So I thought I'd give these on Amazon a try and added them to my subscribe and save. I will be canceling my future orders for these reasons. 1. I can buy the 2oz beef steak, everywhere, for $1.38- these 1oz packages are $1.08 a piece. 2. The quality or freshness is lacking greatly.

I got a coupon for a discount on \"1\" individual item and an envelope so small it wouldn\\'t fit 1 in it let alone 10. I gave up and will no longer buy Jack Link\\'s products. Their customer service is a joke and they instantly treat you like a crook because who in their right mind orders packages of 12 and I must be lying about the mold even after sending pictures.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  These are great, for several reasons:1. The only bad thing in these is salt. So yes, if you are sodium sensitive, these are NOT for you. But if not? Each pack satisfies hunger, has only 50 calories, and is packed with protein. Seriously, you could do much worse.2. See point 1.3. 12 packages in the box.4. Pretty tasty, all things considered. Not the best jerky in the world but for prepackaged long shelf life jerky, it's pretty ok.'Nuff said.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I’m addicted to these things, I’ve probably been getting around 6 or 8 cases per month, if not more.The quality is consistently good, I’ve had maybe one case where the product wasn’t as soft and fresh tasting as usual.My only complaint, and the only reason that I may need to drop some stars if this issue continues, and that’s that every so often I get a box where the jerky has some grows chewy spots.I can go several boxes without the chewy chunks that I have to spit out, I don’t want to know what that is, but it’s disgusting.I stoped buying the Tyson Chicken strips for the same reason. The nasty chewy chunks kept getting progressively more and more consistent, so I had enough of that.I’m hoping that I won’t  have to look look for an alternative to this product as well.This product gets 5 stars for now, but those nasty chunk can be a deal breaker.I’ve also been hooked on this brand’s beef stick and Cheese combo. The original beef and cheese and the jalapeño version are equally as amazing.I can’t count how many cases I’ve already ordered of the beef and cheese, I just ordered the 48 piece case and it’s going quick. My daughter takes them to school and her friends live them so now I’m about ready to order another case.Other then the every so often nasty chunks on this product, I’ve had no real issues with quality, I’m happy with my purchase.Thank you.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  i absolutely loved these. on first bit i thought that it kinda lacked flavor...butonce i actually bit into it... they were REALLY GOOD!!!!!!!This is a nice snack when you are craving like a hamburger or something bad..you can just eat one of these instead and get rid of that hamburger craving,it really helps with weight loss too since they are so low in fat. They are really tasty. I also love how they are individually wrapped. Because when I get the regular bags and i only eat a quarter of the bag then the other pieces will get stale. So these individually wrapped ones I thought were a good idea and it definitely was a good idea. They all stayed nice a fresh and DELICIOUS!!!!! thanks\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I have never had a meat snack that has so much salt in it. They claim 640mg per package, but there is so much salt in it, that it actually makes me nauseous to eat them. And I'm a guy who loves my salt on everything. Mine are going to end up in the trash. What a waste. Jack Links: huge fail on this one.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Jack Link's is a brand we have come to trust in flavor and they have several different varieties of texture.

These are soft but not as soft as a beef stick and not as hard as beef Jerky, they are right in the middle.

I got a coupon for a discount on \"1\" individual item and an envelope so small it wouldn\\'t fit 1 in it let alone 10. I gave up and will no longer buy Jack Link\\'s products. Their customer service is a joke and they instantly treat you like a crook because who in their right mind orders packages of 12 and I must be lying about the mold even after sending pictures.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  These are great, for several reasons:1. The only bad thing in these is salt. So yes, if you are sodium sensitive, these are NOT for you. But if not? Each pack satisfies hunger, has only 50 calories, and is packed with protein. Seriously, you could do much worse.2. See point 1.3. 12 packages in the box.4. Pretty tasty, all things considered. Not the best jerky in the world but for prepackaged long shelf life jerky, it's pretty ok.'Nuff said.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I’m addicted to these things, I’ve probably been getting around 6 or 8 cases per month, if not more.The quality is consistently good, I’ve had maybe one case where the product wasn’t as soft and fresh tasting as usual.My only complaint, and the only reason that I may need to drop some stars if this issue continues, and that’s that every so often I get a box where the jerky has some grows chewy spots.I can go several boxes without the chewy chunks that I have to spit out, I don’t want to know what that is, but it’s disgusting.I stoped buying the Tyson Chicken strips for the same reason. The nasty chewy chunks kept getting progressively more and more consistent, so I had enough of that.I’m hoping that I won’t  have to look look for an alternative to this product as well.This product gets 5 stars for now, but those nasty chunk can be a deal breaker.I’ve also been hooked on this brand’s beef stick and Cheese combo. The original beef and cheese and the jalapeño version are equally as amazing.I can’t count how many cases I’ve already ordered of the beef and cheese, I just ordered the 48 piece case and it’s going quick. My daughter takes them to school and her friends live them so now I’m about ready to order another case.Other then the every so often nasty chunks on this product, I’ve had no real issues with quality, I’m happy with my purchase.Thank you.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  i absolutely loved these. on first bit i thought that it kinda lacked flavor...butonce i actually bit into it... they were REALLY GOOD!!!!!!!This is a nice snack when you are craving like a hamburger or something bad..you can just eat one of these instead and get rid of that hamburger craving,it really helps with weight loss too since they are so low in fat. They are really tasty. I also love how they are individually wrapped. Because when I get the regular bags and i only eat a quarter of the bag then the other pieces will get stale. So these individually wrapped ones I thought were a good idea and it definitely was a good idea. They all stayed nice a fresh and DELICIOUS!!!!! thanks\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I have never had a meat snack that has so much salt in it. They claim 640mg per package, but there is so much salt in it, that it actually makes me nauseous to eat them. And I'm a guy who loves my salt on everything. Mine are going to end up in the trash. What a waste. Jack Links: huge fail on this one.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Jack Link's is a brand we have come to trust in flavor and they have several different varieties of texture. This kind happens to be a favorite of my husband's, my son and I like them as well but they aren't our favorites. Seems everyone in my household has a different type they like. These are soft but not as soft as a beef stick and not as hard as beef Jerky, they are right in the middle.  They are a great size to throw in my husband's lunchbox for a quick snack and there are enough (12) to last for a while as he doesn't eat them everyday.  Overall great value and perfect for my husband!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  The protein/carb amounts are why I bought these but they're not very tasty and hard as can be to chew.  I have super strong teeth and bones (per my docs) and chewing stuff has never been an issue.  Then... I tried one of these and just letting you know, if you have issues with teeth, these may be a no-go.  If you have a loose tooth you want gone, though - these would be sure bet.  Save yourself from going to an orthodontist.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Very tasty, comes in handy for a quick high protein no carb.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Savory and spicy and perfect for a fitness lifestyle.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Just got my order of Ayoba Biltong! Love the whole line but spicy is my favorite. Great father/son company producing an amazing product. I have been lucky enough to enjoy this jerky before it was available to the public. Always my go to jerky!Keep up the great work guys!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  After 66 years of waiting...finally one jerky out of them ALL with NO SUGAR LOADED in blocking any beef flavir the others seem to want to hide at all costs! Insane. This us so good I quit having to make my own jerky which is a big hassle. Oh Boy Oberto was one that had none in past but now? It was too hard and too salty. This stuff is perfect. If I want dessert I buy dessert for sugar sweet stuff.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This beef jerky is exceptional.  However, the price per ounce is not worth it. 2.2 ounces for 9 dollars...pass.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Beef Jerky that doesn't taste like sugar.  Yes!  Thank you, good job.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I do not care for this jerky all! Will not purchase again!. I thought I ordered my usual brand along with ONE of these to try! Instead I received only two of TILLAMOOK. Too spicy, leaves a very greasy feel in mouth but feels dry when eating.  I would love to see other folks opinions!! Thanx for speedy tho!I hope yall truly want honest reviews!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I've been yearning for a sugar free jerky option so I can still have my favorite snack and stay on track for my weight reduction plan.  This has the taste and texture I like plus a hint of heat.  Yummy protein snack !\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  These taste good, theres not a whole lot in the bag, but there really never is with jerky. I enjoy that it is sugar free which is mainly why i purchased. But its good, i had no issues with packing or anything.  would purchase again.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I've been trying all sorts of different jerky products that help make keto easier and more enjoyable  and this is the one for me.  Excellent taste and consistency.  Spicy, not too dry and the cuts are good quality.  Reminds me a lot of the jerky my dad used to make at home when I was a kid.  Easily stacks up against my favorite sugar based brands.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I have tried most of the other jerky products.  They are not as good as Tillamook jerky.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Wonderful flavor, no sugar, but at this time I think to expensive.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This a good, standard jerky without sugar. It is hard to find sugar free jerky and most are way too sweet for me. This product is similar to jerky produced by other major brands in terms of texture and flavor. It is not very tough and lasts a long time even if you open the package. It is my go to product for long trips now.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I purchased these for my youngest son as he is very picky when it comes to snacks especially protein snack he needs when he does Judo or anytime to have a delicious snack, it's worth it however he already ate one package same day he got it darn little stinker, but I'm glad they have such a good deal for this I am definitely planning to get more and see if I can get this on a monthly basis.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The Jack Links beef jerky is great. But I switched to try Jack Links Original Beef Sticks 9 pack and boy was I sorry. They come in a 9 pack multipack and then 3 of the 9 packs for 14.88 so I thought why not. Upon arrival I opened one pack and got me a big old bite. The flavor was alright I guess. But the texture was bad. It’s saltiness and fat were not a good combination.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  If you are watching your carbohydrates, these are a great snack alternative. They have a great spicy taste-just like pepperoni. I’ve been eating them for some time now as a meal replacement, and while they do have high fat content, they are keeping me away from carbs, and I have been dropping unneeded pounds. Besides that, they are just plain ol’ good!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  my favorite sticks by far... they are always good, I\\'ve never had an issue with receiving them or packaging or anything, and the amount of sticks you get for your money is very good as well.... ive had a lot a lot of jerky and every time I go \"off Brand\" to the independent guys I wish I would have just gotten jacks ... very very few times am I disappointed with jacks links\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Is this Jerky? It doesn't say it anywhere in item description nor on the package. But it is some form of dried meat. You get 3 packages of 9 sticks of pepperoni in each one. So 27 sticks for $16 is not a bad deal. Good protein snack to carry around. It is a bit greasy and high in salt but that's pretty standard for dried meat from Jacks.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Subjective attitude, however, these are so tasty, you could almost live on them.  Yes, I will purchase again when needed even though I think they may be a bit over priced.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Great tasting ,very lean and high in  protein  and a recloseable bag\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Too spicy hot. I wanted flavor not the burn. The sticks delivered today are way too hot. I’ve had these before and they must have made a mistake in the recipe. They set your mouth on fire. Remember if it burns going in then it burns on the trip out.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The pros: it doesn't taste that bad for beef sticks and is a great value compared to other similar products.The cons..  It's like eating meat playdough coated in plastic. Other beef sticks have a snap to them.  These do not.  I could envision the machines pumping out this slurry like extruded beef toothpaste before coating it in a thin edible film of something plastic like.  If that doesn't bother you, they taste okay.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Great seller, great taste, good price, fast ship\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Do not order you will not get a pack or 50 you'll only get one stick of jerky i even asked for a replacement and still received only one stick of jerky for a second time\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  My office supplies free snacks to our employees...chips, cookies, etc. I ordered these to mix it up and add some variety to our options. They were such a huge hit that I had to place a double order partially through the month to replenish them. After candy, they are by far the most popular snack we offer to our employees! They're consistently yummy, packaging has always been in good condition, and they arrive on time.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Very disappointed. I ordered this brand because looking at the ingredients list it shows that it doesn't contain red dye. What we received has red dye. Was looking for a snack for my son who is allergic to red dye.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I really like these. I usually get the Slim Jims, then I tried these - they are larger, more substantial, and taste even better. Even though they are larger, the large box they come in is halved (50 count vs. 100 count). But these are wrapped better than the Slim Jims, which often (roll the dice!) had opened and were absolutely awful. Again, these are wrapped better and I haven\\'t had a \"bad\" one yet.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  We are upset that they are out of stock! Have them on a subscription and I even contacted Jack's Links directly to find out when they will have more. We are out and everyone is missing their protein snacks.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Was looking for something to add some protein snacking, every body ate them ,  didn't even last a week they're like crack , even my 2 1/2 yr old was  was grabbing them .\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Omg, I love these beef sticks.  They are so good.  I ate them as a snack when I got hungry in between meals.  They are 2 WW points.  They were not greasy so it wouldn't make my acid reflux flare up.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  These are the perfect, tasty snack. The kids enjoy them. I thought they were the bigger ones but the kids don’t mind. They taste the same, so that’s a plus.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I love the flavor of these beef sticks! They are convenient to take with you anywhere. The are so addictive and low calorie! I love them!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  These are great. I keep a few of these in my diaper bag(toddler loves them too) and thriw a couple in my husband's lunch every day for a snack.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Boy, do the reviews on this product suck. It took me forever to actually decide on these things, so I swore to myself that I would actually help you guys out once I got them.Overall, these snacks are alright, but probably not something I\\'ll order again. They definitely have a pepperoni flavor, so if you\\'re expecting something else then you might want to look elsewhere. They\\'re slightly on the tender side, and a bit oily. Nothing too horrible, but you\\'re probably going to need to wipe your fingers after handling them. The texture is similar to a Slim Jim, but the flavor is very different. It tastes like natural spices, not like pepperoni \"flavor\" or something. There is a bit of an aftertaste that I don\\'t particularly care for, but it\\'s not bad enough to make me hate them. The casing is natural, so there\\'s a bit of snap when you bite into them.These are a bit spicy. They\\'re not going to melt your face off, but they\\'re slightly spicy. After chewing for a couple of seconds, there\\'s a small bite to them on your tongue, and then it goes away. Kind of like mild red pepper you would put on your pizza, but not much. I like the spiciness. I\\'m amazed when people complain about spiciness when they bought a \"pepperoni\" product. These are fine unless you\\'re one of those heathens that can barely handle black pepper on your food.Overall, these are decent. I\\'ve definitely had better pepperoni, and I\\'ve had better jerky. Costco has some jerky links that have better flavor, in my opinion. Still, if you\\'re craving some pepperoni snacks, these really aren\\'t a bad option. You can get better pepperoni out there, but at least these are convenient.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I ordered two 3-packs, expecting to receive the same quality as I would if I bought them at a local grocery store.  When I opened one of the 3-packs I purchased, two of the bags were in disappointing condition. One bag wasn’t vacuum sealed like the other two & the other obviously had some sort of manufacturing defect (see picture). It would have been obvious to the person packing this order because the package in the photo was the bag on top. There is a clearly visible diamond shaped cut in the meat before it was vacuum sealed. Multiple people had to see this and just disregard! This is unacceptable, especially considering how expensive jerky can be. I do not recommend purchasing these. I’d be concerned about the quality & integrity.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Every time I stop by a gas station or liquor store and see those jerky sticks sitting in those plastic bins near the cash register, I want to buy one.  Occasionally I will buy one and every time I do, I totally regret it because they're old, dry and disgusting.I definitely do not regret buying a 3-pack of these though.  It's not as spicy as I would've preferred, but it's got a mild kick and plenty of that saltiness you'd expect from beef pepperoni sticks.In each bag is a single row of jerky sticks, 9 of them.  It seems to be sealed airtight, and there's a slight film of oil over the jerky (presumably to reduce contact with air).  Not nearly as greasy as a Slim Jim though.  Just wipe your fingers before typing on the keyboard again.Package says to consume within 3 days after opening or otherwise store the rest in the fridge.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  These are among the best beef sticks I have ever purchased from a retail store. However, for some reason they seem to be a little bit hard to find around here, where is the beef jerky is everywhere. These are a reasonable price, and make a great low-carb snack when paired with cheese sticks. I will definitely be buying these again.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  These things are addictive...I like these enough to actually have them on my Subscription service...  They tend to be fairly good quality, very flavorful, and all around a great quick snack when you're hungry and don't have time to actually stop to fix something.  I'll often grab one or two of these on my way to work and they will keep me from hitting up the café or vending machine most of the day till I get home.I'm sure others will tell you that there are way better quality ones out there or that these aren't dolphin safe or something but honestly, they are a great price and when you consider that into the equation they are hard to beat.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I compared these Jack Links beef snack sticks with the Wisconsin smoked sausages (Snack Sticks)  in the tub the other Wisconsin beef sausages in the bag - they were similar yet different - the ones in the tub were tapered and sealed at the ends like proper linked sausages, they were more smokey than the bagged kind - those had straight cut ends, not tapered like links. Those also had a more acrid flavor than the tub packed linked type. Obviously I prefer the tub of smokey link like beef sausages. But both were acceptable, kielbasa textured and flavoured sausages. The Jack Links were on par with the tub variety of the Wisconsin smoked beef sausages. but again, all three were very kielbasa like beef sticks, and all three very edible protein snacks.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  These pepperoni beef sticks are excellent.  Lean, flavorful, firm, and with a bit of spice.  Since I can never find the old fashioned dry pepperoni sticks that the bars had just hanging around in the \\'50s and \\'60s,  I have to go with the Link\\'s.  Low/no sugar, carbs, or trans fats, these meaty little wonders are my go-to snack.Just as importantly, the Link\\'s Pepperoni Beef sticks list ingredients that DO NOT include \"beef hearts\",  that junk that you often find in other meat sticks.Well recommended.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Being a camper and a boat owner, I am constantly looking for foods that taste good and don't require refrigeration. These are the tops! They don't taste funny and they are not all dried out. They can last a week or two after you open the package, as long as you keep them cool and in the dark. They are the closest thing to sausage that I can find. Lately, I've been throwing them in a skillet with my pancakes. Add a glass of dehydrated milk and you have a fine breakfast, no fridge required!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  When it comes to pepperoni, I was spoiled after eating a similar product made in a small meat market in Port Angeles, WA that surpassed any commercial pepperoni ... until now, that is.  Jack Link's Pepperoni Beef Sticks easily satisfies my taste buds; the large quantity that I purchase being a testimonial to that.  It may just be my belly talking, but this company has at least one happy, devoted customer for as long as they continue to make pepperoni sticks using this current recipe.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  1.  VERY BLAND, YUCKY TASTE2.  WEIRD, CHEAPEST POSSIBLE PACKAGING I'VE SEEN3.

Buyer beware!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  So glad I had these on my trip to China. Better meat than most anything you can buy there and also a life saver during the 30+ hours of flight time. Only problem is that my kids ate everything left behind while I was gone. Will buy again.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I thought I found a good deal, I just wanted beef sticks so the cheese was an extra bonus. I was wrong. The cheese is like an extra penalty, I've eaten two sticks and cannot physically or mentally bring myself to eat another one they taste so bad. I set my expectations low because it's obviously not going to be great cheese and I was still disappointed. The beef stick is average and honestly not worth the price considering the whole package and other available options.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I ordered the two pack of 16 count -for a total of  32 count. I only got one box with 16 in it.  Customer service fixed my order and is sending me the second box.  I have seen other reviewers have also reported this problem, but luckily customer service made it right.As for the flavor, the kids and I really enjoyed these.  The cheese reminded us a little like Kraft cheese and cracker packs (the ones with the red cheese spread sticks).  The jerky reminds me of a mild slim jim flavor.  I could see us buying more in the future but leery of ordering from this listing due to the quantity issue.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  These are a repurchase for our household, my husband takes them in his lunch and loves them. The box sometimes comes crushed but we don’t eat the box, and the product has always been very good. Will continue to repurchase if the price stays within our budget.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Let me preface this by saying that I am one of the least picky people I know when it comes to food. It does not need to be a gourmet meal to impress me, and there are few things I actually dislike enough to not eat once they’re paid for.These beef sticks are less flavorful than slim Jim’s, and they dont really make up for it with any other quality. I’m going to eat them eventually, but compared to the general enjoyment I’ve got for other jack links or beef sticks, these are lacking.The cheese, though. I don’t know what this is. I realize the cheeses that come packaged with beef sticks aren’t exactly known for their succulence or deliciousness, but wow. The cheese tastes and feels like it was created from some kind of powder, with the wrong ratio of ingredients and moisture level.The packaging is good and the value (cost vs quantity only).Seriously, meat and cheese are damn near my two favorite kinds of food ever, but I’ll be giving these away at work. Stick to their other snacks and give these a pass, so that they disappear for good.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Good flavor. I thought this combination of cheese and meat was nice but would have preferred they be combined into the meat and not a cheese stick and meat separately. I also had some bad luck with the packaging as half the snacks in the box wouldn't open as the peal back film simply wasn't present on them and had to try and cut open each snack with scissors and a knife. This took alot of time and was messy. Very unacceptable. I hope other Jack Link products I bought won't be like this.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  Very yummy combo if you like meat and cheese.  Sure the cheese tastes like easy cheese in a stick form, but hey i like processed cheese.  The meat and cheese are packaged separately, but in a pack together not touching if that makes sense.  I ordered the the two boxes of 16 for a total of 32 individual pieces.  Only one box of 16 arrived.  I chatted with Amazon customer service and they offered me a refund or replacement.  I choose the replacement and it arrived in a timely manner.  So i'm happy!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I like to mix it up a bit with my hiking snacks so I do not get bored eating the same old things so when I run out one type of snack, I try something else. This has not always worked out as sometimes I end up with a loser. This was a new item to try for me and was a little worried it would be too spicy but it was not. The combination of the beef stick and the mild cheese was a perfect snack. Neither was over powering but they were not whimpy on taste either. Plus the bonus fact that you get so many in one box is great. Although I will continue to mix it up with trying new things, I keep a list of ones to try again and ones to never try again. This one goes on the list of \"keepers\".\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I purchased these for office snacks, but I have to admit a few didn't make it to the office.  Very yummy tasty combination of meat and cheese.  Not messy at all and just the right amount.

This didn't happen every time, but it happened too many times for me.  Oddly, this didn't seem to bother my son, who's a very picky eater?► Update:After trying a couple other brands of beef jerky, my son asked me to buy this brand again.  Because of this, I've upgraded this review from 3 stars to 4 stars.  I'd like to give this jerky a higher score, but getting those occasional rubbery pieces makes me think 4 out of 5 is a fair score.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  If you like Jack Link's jerky and you like Cholula sauce or similar flavors, you ought to really like this, because the taste is really just like the stuff in the little wood-knobbed bottles.  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I'm not enough of a jerky maven over all, to know whether Jack Link's is top-notch in the world of jerky; I just know I like it way better than lots of others I've tried, which to me have a strong chemical undertaste, or seem more grainy, less meaty than Jack Link's brand.My number one favorite Jack Link's flavor is the jalapeno, so if you like jerky in general and/or Jack Link's in particular, and you appreciate real jalapeno flavor, you might want to try that as well.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I bought a few different kind being new to jerky.  I found I liked this one best.It has a strong smell so if you're in a small room or vehicle with others, they might disagree with your choice of snack.  Very filling option for the calories and other than the high-sodium, is a healthy choice.Note:  I've noticed with this and other bags, it's kind of hit or miss on the texture of the jerky. Some will be 'just right', and others hard to chew.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This is the best beef Jerky I have ever had. I have been eatting it for years now, and another positive is that it is made in Wisconsin. My only wish is that you could buy this stuff in bigger bags. The small bags are nice for snacking, but it would nice to be able to buy it in 2 - 3 lb bags for taking camping or on deployments. At least I can save some money and buy it here on amazon instead of at the store. This is also the best flavor in my opinion in their line-up. I have tried almost all of them, and this is the best. As long as amazon keeps selling this flavor, I will keep buying it.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Honestly, Jack Link's Beef Jerky is some of the best I've had, next to stepping into a Slim Jim.. OH YAH, but apart from that I ate a few bags throughout the course of a week and I couldn't stop the runs. I think my stomach didn't like all the spices in them so next time i order a 4 pack I think it will be the turkey jerky.On the positive note, my cat loves this stuff and goes crazy for this but not catnip. I have no idea, and it's strange.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I had always purchased local jerky products. I also got a little tired of Jack Link\\'s Sasquatch ads. When I heard they had Cholula jerky and read  some background about Jack Link\\'s I just had to try it. It was so delicious that I had a hard time not to eat the whole package in one sitting. Ditto for my son and grandson! Amazon\\'s price is quite competitive and I\\'ll surely add some more to my next Amazon order. My wife thought it too spicy but she\\'s a \"spice wimp\"!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I asked my boyfriend to take me out for a nice steak dinner to celebrate our anniversary, but he gave me this instead. At first I was disappointed, but the taste is out of this world. I never knew dehydrated meat could be so flavorful!My only complaint is that might boyfriend didn't splurge and get me the jerky that comes in the tin, like chewing tobacco. I guess no one's perfect though.I think I'll keep him anyway.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I fell in love with Jack Links Cholula flavored Beef Jerky when I was in Mississippi but when I have had trouble finding it in other states. I love the convenience of being able to order these online. They have the delicious flavor of hot sauce without being overly spicy.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Good quality product. The jerky was well favored and had the right texture for me.  I have had some jerky that was very hard and jaw breaking to chew. But this was very good, flexible enough to rip into smaller bits but no so much so that you question the quality of the product. I will be getting this jerky again.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Not everyone likes the sweet flavor added to beef jerky. Too much sugar makes them more like junk food. Other than that, they don't taste so bad. Wish there were plain plain beef jerky available for the health conscious individual.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Love these links.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Good taste  soft enough to break with your fingerscant get enough of thesebag is decently filled\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Chewing, tender and delicious! Best price around.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  only 4 or 5 pieces in bag ......not worth the money\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Standard great quality and taste\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  needs to be bigger if im going to buy it online..\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Taste Great!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Good deal\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  since this review contains a sort of a rudimentary comparison test of several different jerkies [with regards to 'toughness'] I've ordered at the same time on amazon, i'll copy/paste it under all of the products included below....recently, I've ordered turkey jerky samplers from 6 different companies via amazon... I chose those 6 based on other customers' amazon reviews, i.e. I picked the ones who had the most positive reviews with at least 50 reviews each...I love turkey jerky because it tends to be much more tender than beef jerky.... to be fair in this review, I have to state that I currently have a pretty significant tooth loss, mainly due to my disability/osteoporosis thus i'm not able to take on the toughest jerky any longer like I could a couple of decades ago...the companies I ordered from were:- jack links [msg free turkey jerky, original flavor, 4-pack of 2.85oz bags],- oberto [all natural turkey jerky, teriyaki flavor, 4-pack of 3.25oz bags],- think jerky [free range turkey jerky, thanksgiving flavor, 8-pack of 1.5oz bags; gluten free],- country archer [turkey jerky, hickory smoke flavor, 8oz bag; antibiotic & gluten free],- field trip [all natural turkey jerky, cracked pepper flavor, 12oz bag; high protein, gluten free],- turkey perky jerky [sweet & snappy flavor, 14oz bag, tender, marinated, handcrafted seasoned jerky]…flavor is a highly subjective matter so i'll skip this subject for the most part... instead, here are my ratings of toughest to most tender jerky from the list above, listed in the same order but with additional comments:[reviewed product]jack links - the absolute worst imo with regards to ease of chewing... I couldn't chomp down even a single piece from the 2.85oz bag i opened, some pieces were pure gristle [yuck] and others could likely serve as tough thin soles for durable footwear... gave the remaining 3 baggies to my neighbor who has 3 sons in 20s/early 30s and whose teeth are evidently far more up to the challenge of taking on super tough meat because the were very appreciative of all the jerky I passed on to them...https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HPPPKRM/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&th=1oberto - different appearance from the above jerky... although almost as tough as jack links, I was able to actually chew a couple of pieces completely... overwhelming majority of the contents was unchewable for me however...gave the remaining 3 baggies to my neighbor and his sons...https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HPPPKRM/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&th=1think jerky - I loved the 'thanksgiving' flavor of this product, however, this was third in toughness rating... i really wanted to like this for the flavor alone so I tried 4 out of the 8 tiny bags i received but had to concede at last...i was able to chomp down about half of a couple of the baggies, the other 2 i could only chew successfully only about 1/3 of the contents... gave away the remaining 4 packets to my neighbor/his sons...https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0714KSKG9/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&th=1country archer - i kind of liked the flavor of this one as well although the appearance and texture were quite different from the 'thanksgiving' jerky above....to my recollection, i was able to chew down and consume about 3/4 of the 8oz bag's content...i threw away the rest....https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LYRFILD/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&th=1field trip - i was able to chomp down and consume most of the large 12oz bag, although majority of the pieces i couldn't, were pretty unappetizing - basically almost gag-inducing, soft but endlessly-chewy gristle with a couple of larger super tough, hard pieces...the unappetizing pieces kind of ruined the positive experience for me and the general memory/recollection of this product is overwhelmed by the negative aspect....quickly spat out the gristle containing pieces and discarded the bag with still quite a bit of unpalatable product by weight inside it....this one was most like the 'perky jerky' below regarding the taste/texture btw....i think both might be suffering a bit from being over marinated....https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V3M9HSU/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&th=1perky jerky - by far the most tender and i had no difficulty chowing down the entire huge 14oz bag... however, this jerky's taste, color/appearance and texture was the least appealing to me... it was way too sweet and had kind of molasses-like, malty flavor and texture for my preferences...i think it might have been due to being over marinated?....it's very dark and imo bit of 'un-turkey like' in appearance....based on this experience, a few days after i consumed the jerky above, i then ordered several full samplers from perky jerky directly via their websites; because most of their other product isn't currently available on amazon...i ordered a full sampler of their turkey jerky, along with full sampler packs of their beef jerky and wagyu beef jerky...to sum it up - until i'll purchase a couple of higher end dehydrators and plunge into the process of making my own beef/turkey jerky, i'll be ordering my jerky from 'perky jerky'... there were 2 turkey jerky variations from their sampler i liked very much and which were nearly as tender as their 'sweet & snappy' but more appealing taste-wise to me...surprisingly, there were also 2 or even 3 beef jerky samples which i found very tender and i'm keeping all those empty bags for now, along with some short, basic notes on my initial flavor/texture/toughness-tenderness experience for each, until i'll place my next order with them [blew my budget to hell so i'll have to wait a month or so before i can spend $100 or so to satiate my cravings hehe]…in my experience their wagyu beef - although supposedly a premium/higher end product - was generally tougher/containing more gristle than either of the other [turkey and 'regular' beef] products....i'll copy/paste this review without any changes for the most part, under each of the products above I've ordered via amazon...hope this will help some folks, particularly perhaps those who are dentally challenged like i am and who also still regularly love to chomp down on [tender] jerky nevertheless... cheers....\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I’ve purchased these before and liked it but was extremely disappointed to open this and see some of the meat a little greyish appearing with mold all over it.Disgusting and a complete waste of money.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I was not sure I would like this, but I was looking for a  high protein snack.  I see these advertised every week when watching Major League Fishing, so I decided to try this brand.  I got turkey instead of beef because I thought it would be less heavy.  I worried it would be too salty, but it was very well seasoned.  I wish no seasoning was added, but it is not overwhelming.  I have been using this as a snack whenever I get hunger pangs outside of meal times.  I have managed to lose a few pounds just by eating this instead of reaching for a snack that would be less satisfying and contain empty calories. The protein keeps me going.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  So this order is supposed to contain 4 packs of jerky. My first order contained one pack of jerky.Submitted the missing items request and got a replacement order of 1 pack of jerky.So I now have half of my order and I see no option to return or even request the still missing packs besent? Buy elsewhere, you will just get ripped off with this selection!!!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I'm seriously surprised at all the positive reviews...I have good teeth but this turkey jerky is simply terrible. Way too dry and though.You have to chew on a bite forever before you can safely swallow it.My hopes were that these would be similar in texture to the flat Jack Link Turkey Jerky strips they sell as singles at the conveniences stores. They're are nothing like those.I won't be buying them again.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  My UPS delivery driver just stood there when I opened the door. He did not say anything to me. He did not make any gesture to me. He just hid behind his sunglasses, jangled his keys, and walked slowly back to his truck. He did not greet me or say goodbye. The only thing he did was put my packages on the ground and then knock on the door. He looked at me but said absolutely nothing and just jangled his keys. The jerky is good.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I ride a bicycle and I have a hard time finding lean protein in the wilds of Kansas City. This jerky is easy enough to carry and pleasant to eat. I just wish it had less salt - by far. IDK how curing works - is this much salt necc?To be clear, I wish for less salt for nutrition and for taste. I generally eat a whole package at once and the extreme saltiness really makes itself known - and remembered - by the end of the bag.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I prefer Whole Foods 365 Turkey Jerky, but thought I would give Jack Link's  (JL) a day in court.The first thing I noticed:  JL is *significantly* tougher/harder than 365 Turkey Jerky --of course, it cost less, too.The flavor is fine etc etc just don't plan on eating the JL very fast!!!Glad I bought the JL\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I have ordered this before and was very satisfied.  However this time I ordered and only received 1 package when there are supposed to be 4?Not sure what happened.  See attached pic.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Flavor was pretty good. My dog knows when I get a bag before it comes out of the box.  She is right there waiting for it to be opened.  Some pieces were a little took thick and folded over thus too chewy.  Otherwise. It was good.  A little pricey for the small amount.\\n\\n', '']\n"

       "2  finding clean, minimally processed protein snacks for a busy life is more challenging than i thought! cheez-its and pretzels just don't satisfy my needs for an active, on the go lifestyle. but wait! here comes stryve biltong to save the day!biltong and traditional beef jerky are more different than you may assume. beef jerky is more tender due to the higher amount of fat (and in most commercial brands, carbs) with added flavorings and sodium. this biltong, however, has a much rougher texture that is quite chewy. the flavor is that of thick flank steak- flavorful, but not overly fatty or tender like a ney-york strip.the biltong in my bag was fresh, not moldy, and the bag was completely sealed. i could not be happier with this purchase, and the only problem is i've eaten the bag too fast...   \n",
